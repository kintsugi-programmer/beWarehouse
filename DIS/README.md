# **Lecture 1: Designing Interactive Systems**

---

### **1. Overview of the Lecture**
The first lecture in the course *Design of Interactive Systems (DIS)* lays the foundational principles for understanding how interactive systems are designed, evaluated, and optimized. The lecture is structured around multiple disciplines, including *Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)*, *User Experience (UX)*, and *Interaction Design (ID)*. It highlights essential concepts such as usability, user-centered design, and the role of technology in shaping user interactions.

The lecture is conducted by **Dr. Kalpana Shankhwar**, an **Assistant Professor at IIIT Delhi** with a background in **Mechanical Engineering**. Her research focuses on VR-based simulations, interactive wall development, gesture-based game design, and haptic devices for medical training.

---

### **2. What is an Interactive System?**
An **interactive system** is a **technology-driven interface that allows users to interact with digital content in a meaningful way**. Examples of interactive systems include:
- **Smartphones**
- **Websites and Mobile Applications**
- **Automobiles with interactive dashboards**
- **Cash Dispensing Machines (ATMs)**
- **Interactive ticket vending machines**
- **Household smart appliances like smart refrigerators and voice assistants**

#### **Characteristics of Interactive Systems**
- They involve **information processing, transmission, storage, or transformation**.
- They should be **usable, accessible, and engaging**.
- They are built around human needs rather than technological capabilities.

A crucial aspect emphasized in the lecture is the **human-centered approach**, where **designing for users’ needs, behaviors, and expectations** is a priority.

---

### **3. Key Disciplines in Interactive System Design**
The lecture discusses three major disciplines that contribute to interactive system design:

#### **A. Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**
> “HCI focuses on human-centeredness and usability concerns.” 

HCI ensures that technology is:
- **Easy to use**
- **Easy to learn**
- **Efficient in achieving user goals**

HCI encompasses methods, guidelines, and standards to ensure an **intuitive experience**.

#### **B. Interaction Design (ID)**
> “Interaction Design promotes a seamless interaction between users and products.”

Interaction Design is a sub-discipline within UX design that focuses on:
- **Microinteractions** (button clicks, animations, transitions)
- **Motion-based interactions** (scrolling effects, transitions)
- **Gestural inputs** (touch, swipe, pinch, voice)

##### **Five Dimensions of Interaction Design**
1. **1D - Words** (e.g., labels, instructions)
2. **2D - Visual Representation** (e.g., icons, colors)
3. **3D - Physical Objects/Space** (e.g., touchscreen, VR controls)
4. **4D - Time** (e.g., animations, loading time)
5. **5D - Behavior** (e.g., user response, AI predictions)

#### **C. User Experience (UX) Design**
> “UX design involves the entire process of acquiring and integrating a product, including branding, usability, and function.”

UX design is **holistic**—it considers:
- **User expectations and emotional responses**
- **Aesthetic and functional aspects of design**
- **Seamless integration of technology and human interaction**

##### **Example: Apple’s UX Strategy**
Apple’s product design (iPhone, MacBook) is a classic example of **good UX**. The intuitive interface, **minimalistic design**, **smooth animations**, and **accessibility features** make the user experience **effortless**.

---

### **4. The Role of UI Design**
**User Interface (UI) Design** focuses on the **visual aesthetics and layout** of interactive systems. Key aspects include:
- **Color theory** for readability and engagement
- **Typography and font selection**
- **Iconography and symbols for easy navigation**
- **Layout structure (grid, alignment) for consistency**

UI design is crucial for **creating interfaces that are visually appealing and functionally efficient**.

#### **Example: Google’s UI Design Philosophy**
- **Material Design Principles** focus on **real-world physics, clean typography, and intuitive motion**.

# **Lecture 2: PACT – A Framework for Designing Interactive Systems**

---

### **1. Overview of the Lecture**
Lecture 2 of *Design of Interactive Systems (DIS)* introduces **PACT**, a structured framework used in **human-centered interactive system design**. PACT stands for:
1. **People**
2. **Activities**
3. **Contexts**
4. **Technologies**

The **PACT framework** helps designers analyze **interactive systems** by considering the relationship between these four factors. By using PACT, designers ensure that systems are:
- **User-friendly**
- **Contextually relevant**
- **Efficient and accessible**
- **Technically feasible**

The lecture emphasizes the **human-centered approach**, where technology is **designed around human needs rather than forcing humans to adapt to technology**.

---

## **2. Understanding PACT: The Four Elements of Interaction Design**

PACT is a **design thinking approach** that helps in structuring interactive system design by focusing on **users, their activities, the context in which they interact, and the technologies they use**.

### **A. People: The Human Factor**
> "People differ in various ways, and design must consider these differences."

When designing an interactive system, it is crucial to understand that **no two users are alike**. People differ in:
- **Physical capabilities** (vision, hearing, dexterity)
- **Psychological traits** (memory, attention, cognitive abilities)
- **Social and cultural backgrounds** (language, habits, motivations)

#### **1. Physical Differences**
People experience the world through **five senses**:
- **Sight** (visual design, color contrast, accessibility)
- **Touch** (haptic feedback, touchscreens)
- **Hearing** (voice commands, audio cues)
- **Smell & Taste** (not common in digital design)

##### **Example: Ergonomics in Design**
> "The study of relationships between people and their environment."

- **Ergonomics** ensures that devices are **comfortable and safe** to use.
- Factors like **screen brightness, keyboard spacing, touch sensitivity** impact usability.
- Example: **Smartphone UI** is optimized for **one-handed use** by placing navigation controls at the bottom.

##### **Fitts’s Law**
> "The time required to reach a target depends on its size and distance."

- If buttons are **too small or too far apart**, they become **difficult to use**.
- Example: **Large touch targets in mobile apps** improve accuracy.

#### **2. Psychological Differences**
- **Users remember concepts better than isolated details**.
- **Clear instructions and visual cues** improve usability.
- Some users prefer **text**, others prefer **images or videos**.

##### **Mental Models in Design**
> “Users form mental models of how a system works.”

- If a **design aligns with user expectations**, learning is easier.
- Example: A **shopping cart icon** intuitively represents **adding items to a cart**.

##### **Norman’s Theory on Mental Models (1986)**
- **Mental models are incomplete** – users may only understand parts of a system.
- **They are unstable** – users forget details over time.
- **They are unscientific** – users may develop superstitions about system behavior.
- Example: **Pressing the elevator button multiple times doesn’t make it come faster, but users still do it**.

#### **3. Social Differences**
- Users have **different motivations** for using a system.
- **Beginners need guidance**, while **experts prefer shortcuts**.
- Some users **easily give up**, while others **explore features**.

##### **Example: Netflix Personalization**
- **Beginners** get **recommendations based on popularity**.
- **Long-time users** get **personalized content suggestions**.

---

### **B. Activities: Understanding User Interactions**
Activities refer to **what users do with the system**. Different tasks require **different interaction designs**.

#### **1. Temporal Aspects (Time-Based Factors)**
- **Frequent vs. Infrequent use** – A **daily banking app** should have a simple login, while **a tax-filing app** can have a more detailed workflow.
- **Time pressure** – Systems used in **high-stress environments** (e.g., hospital software) should be **fast and error-free**.
- **Interruptions** – Users may be distracted, so **auto-save and undo features** are crucial.

#### **2. Cooperation (Team-Based Workflows)**
- Some activities involve **multiple users** (e.g., Google Docs allows real-time collaboration).

#### **3. Complexity of Tasks**
- **Simple tasks** (checking the weather) require **minimal UI**.
- **Complex tasks** (photo editing) require **advanced features but should remain user-friendly**.

#### **4. Safety-Critical Tasks**
- In fields like **aviation, healthcare, and finance**, **error prevention** is critical.
- Example: **Undo options in medical software prevent accidental deletions**.

##### **Example: ATM User Experience**
- **Simple, fast transactions** (cash withdrawal, balance check).
- **Clear, step-by-step instructions**.
- **Error prevention mechanisms** (e.g., timeout if the user forgets their card).

---

### **C. Context: The Environment in Which Interaction Occurs**
Context refers to the **conditions under which users interact with the system**. The three major contexts are:

#### **1. Organizational Context**
- Corporate systems require **security, scalability, and efficiency**.
- Example: **Enterprise software like SAP and Salesforce**.

#### **2. Social Context**
- Some systems encourage **social interaction** (e.g., Facebook, WhatsApp).
- Example: **LinkedIn promotes professional networking**.

#### **3. Physical Context**
- Users might interact **indoors (home, office) or outdoors (while driving, at the gym)**.
- Example: **Voice commands in Google Assistant allow hands-free interaction**.

##### **Example: ATM Design and Contextual Considerations**
- Placed in **secure locations**.
- Screen visibility should be **optimized for outdoor use**.
- Should allow **multiple languages** for accessibility.

---

### **D. Technologies: Choosing the Right Tools**
Technology refers to the **medium of interaction**. Designers must consider:

#### **1. Input Technologies**
- **Keyboards, touchscreens, voice recognition**.
- Example: **Touchless payment systems (Apple Pay, Google Pay)**.

#### **2. Output Technologies**
- **Displays (LCD, LED, AR/VR screens)**.
- **Audio feedback for accessibility**.

#### **3. Communication Technologies**
- **Wired vs. Wireless** (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 5G).
- Example: **Bluetooth earbuds allow hands-free communication**.

#### **4. Content Considerations**
- Content should be **relevant, up-to-date, and well-presented**.
- Example: **Streaming platforms optimize video quality based on internet speed**.

---

## **3. Scoping a Problem with PACT**
A **PACT analysis** helps in:
- **Understanding user needs**.
- **Evaluating design decisions**.
- **Improving existing systems**.

### **Example: PACT Analysis for University Lab Access System**
| **PACT Element** | **Analysis** |
|-----------------|--------------|
| **People** | Students, lecturers, technicians |
| **Activities** | Security clearance, opening the door |
| **Contexts** | Indoor, users carrying books |
| **Technologies** | Keycards, biometric scanners, PIN entry |

---

## **4. Class Activity: PACT Analysis for a Vending Machine**
The lecture ends with an activity where students must perform a **PACT analysis for a vending machine**.

### **Example Solution: PACT Analysis for Vending Machine**
| **PACT Element** | **Analysis** |
|-----------------|--------------|
| **People** | Students, employees, visitors |
| **Activities** | Selecting an item, inserting money, retrieving the product |
| **Contexts** | Indoor/outdoor, noise levels, weather conditions |
| **Technologies** | Touchscreens, card payments, cash slots |

---

## **Conclusion**
PACT is a **systematic way** to **analyze and design** interactive systems by considering:
✔ **User diversity** (physical, psychological, social differences).  
✔ **Task complexity** (frequent/infrequent tasks, time pressure).  
✔ **Environmental context** (indoor/outdoor, individual/collaborative use).  
✔ **Appropriate technologies** (input/output methods, content, communication).  

By applying **PACT**, designers can create **human-centered, effective, and accessible interactive systems**.

# **Lecture 3: The Process of Human-Centered Interactive Systems Design**

---

### **1. Overview of the Lecture**
Lecture 3 in the *Design of Interactive Systems (DIS)* course introduces the **process of designing human-centered interactive systems**. The primary goal of this lecture is to establish a **systematic approach to designing interactive systems that prioritize human needs, behaviors, and usability**.

The lecture emphasizes:
1. **Understanding** – Researching user needs and requirements.
2. **Designing** – Developing conceptual and physical designs.
3. **Envisioning** – Creating representations of design ideas.
4. **Evaluating** – Testing and refining the design.

The lecture also introduces **scenarios and personas** as tools to understand user interactions and ensure the system aligns with their expectations.

---

## **2. The Core Principles of Human-Centered Interactive Systems Design**

### **A. Design as a Creative and Iterative Process**
> "Design is a creative process that involves conscious change and communication between designers and users."

Unlike traditional engineering, **interactive system design is not purely technical**; it involves an iterative, user-focused approach that continuously adapts based on evaluation and feedback.

Different disciplines approach design differently:
- Some designs are **stand-alone systems**.
- Others **integrate with existing (legacy) systems**.

Thus, a **flexible approach** is required to balance **creativity, usability, and technical feasibility**.

---

### **B. Four Key Activities in the Human-Centered Design Process**
The **design process** involves four fundamental activities:

#### **1. Understanding**
> "Understanding is about knowing what the system has to do, what it has to be like, and how it fits into the ecosystem."

Designers must **study people, activities, and contexts** relevant to the domain. This step includes:
- **User research** – Gathering insights from real-world users.
- **Functional & Non-functional requirements**:
  - **Functional:** Core functionalities (e.g., an ATM should allow withdrawals).
  - **Non-functional:** Usability, performance, security.

##### **Example: E-Commerce Website**
- **Functional:** Users should be able to add products to the cart.
- **Non-functional:** The website should load in under 3 seconds.

#### **2. Design**
> "Design involves both conceptual design and physical design."

Design is **split into two stages**:
1. **Conceptual Design** – Abstract design process (focuses on ‘what’ rather than ‘how’).
   - Example: **Use Cases**, **Entity-Relationship Models**, **Wireframes**.
   - Keeps things **abstract** to define **core interactions** before implementation.

2. **Physical Design** – Making abstract concepts **concrete**.
   - Focuses on **interface elements, interactions, and system architecture**.

##### **Example: Banking App**
- **Conceptual Design:** Sketching the flow of login, balance check, and transactions.
- **Physical Design:** Defining UI components (buttons, color schemes, typography).

#### **3. Envisionment**
> "Designs need to be visualized to clarify ideas and enable evaluation."

Before building a full system, **prototypes and mock-ups** are created:
- **Low-Fidelity Prototypes** – Sketches, storyboards, paper prototypes.
- **High-Fidelity Prototypes** – Functional prototypes with limited features.

##### **Example: Mobile App Design**
- **Sketches** of different screens help refine the layout.
- **Interactive mock-ups** allow testing before full implementation.

#### **4. Evaluation**
> "Evaluation ensures the design meets user needs and functions correctly."

Evaluation is **continuous** throughout the process. It includes:
- **Designer self-checks** (verifying requirements).
- **Client feedback** (reviewing wireframes and prototypes).
- **User testing** (observing real users interact with the system).

##### **Example: A/B Testing for a Website**
- Two designs are tested on real users.
- The one with **higher engagement** and **better usability** is chosen.

---

## **3. Developing Personas and Scenarios**
**Personas and scenarios** are essential for human-centered design.

### **A. Personas: Representing Users**
> "Personas are concrete representations of the different types of people who will use the system."

**A persona should include:**
- **Name & Background**
- **Goals & Aspirations**
- **Pain Points (Problems They Face)**
- **Technology Comfort Level**

##### **Example: Persona for a Fitness App**
| **Attribute**  | **Details** |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Name** | Ayesha Sharma |
| **Age** | 28 |
| **Occupation** | Software Engineer |
| **Goals** | Wants to track calories and exercise progress easily |
| **Pain Points** | Finds most fitness apps too complex |
| **Tech Skills** | Intermediate |

Using this persona, the app should have:
✔ A **simple UI** with clear calorie tracking.  
✔ **Easy logging of workouts** without complex steps.  

---

### **B. Scenarios: Real-World User Interactions**
> "Scenarios are stories about users engaging with the system in different contexts."

Scenarios help designers **visualize user interactions**. They are **progressively detailed**:

1. **Stories** – Real-world experiences (e.g., diary entries, observations).
2. **Conceptual Scenarios** – Abstract descriptions removing unnecessary details.
3. **Concrete Scenarios** – Adding specific design elements and interactions.
4. **Use Cases** – Defining **detailed system interactions**.

##### **Example: ATM Use Case**
| **Scenario**  | **Details** |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Story** | A user needs to withdraw cash. |
| **Conceptual Scenario** | A person interacts with an ATM for a transaction. |
| **Concrete Scenario** | User enters PIN, selects amount, confirms withdrawal. |
| **Use Case** | The ATM system verifies credentials, deducts balance, and dispenses cash. |

---

## **4. Scenario-Based Design Method**
The **Scenario-Based Design Method** formalizes how **different scenarios help in different design stages**:
1. **Understanding Users** – Stories capture real-world insights.
2. **Envisioning Designs** – Conceptual scenarios help designers brainstorm.
3. **Prototyping and Testing** – Concrete scenarios define the system structure.
4. **Final Implementation** – Use cases refine user interactions and system logic.

---

## **5. Implementation and Product Development**
> "Ultimately, systems must be implemented, tested, and launched."

Once the design process is complete:
✔ The system is **developed and tested**.  
✔ **Bugs and issues are fixed** before launch.  
✔ The **final product is deployed** to users.  

##### **Example: Developing a Smart Home App**
1. **Conceptual Design** – Outlining how users will control lights and appliances.
2. **Physical Design** – Designing the UI for mobile and voice control.
3. **Envisionment** – Creating interactive prototypes.
4. **Evaluation** – User testing and feedback.
5. **Implementation** – Coding and integrating with smart devices.

---

## **6. Class Activity**
**Task: Analyze a vending machine system using personas and scenarios.**
1. **Observe** how users interact with vending machines.
2. **Document real-life stories** (e.g., a user struggling with payment).
3. **Develop a conceptual scenario** (e.g., user selects a product and makes payment).
4. **Define a concrete scenario** (e.g., user inserts a card, machine verifies, dispenses product).
5. **Create a use case** (e.g., system logic for product selection, payment processing, and dispensing).

---

## **Conclusion**
This lecture provides a **structured approach to human-centered interactive system design**, emphasizing:
✔ **Understanding user needs and requirements**.  
✔ **Conceptual and physical design principles**.  
✔ **The role of personas and scenarios in interaction design**.  
✔ **The iterative process of envisionment, evaluation, and implementation**.  

By following this approach, designers can create **intuitive, efficient, and user-friendly interactive systems**.

# **Lecture 4: Usability in Interactive Systems**

---

### **1. Overview of the Lecture**
Lecture 4 of *Design of Interactive Systems (DIS)* focuses on **Usability**, which is central to **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**. The lecture defines **usability**, explores **key usability principles**, and examines how **design principles** impact user experience.

The lecture emphasizes:
- **Usability Goals** – How to make systems **easy to use, efficient, and flexible**.
- **Accessibility and Acceptability** – Ensuring systems are **usable by diverse users**.
- **Norman’s Usability Model** – The **gulf of execution** and **gulf of evaluation**.
- **Key Design Principles** – Including **visibility, consistency, feedback, and error recovery**.

---

## **2. What is Usability?**
> *"Usability is that systems should be easy to use, easy to learn, flexible, and should engender a good attitude in people (Shackel, 1990)."*

Usability is the **quality of user interaction** with a system. It ensures that **users can efficiently and effectively complete tasks without frustration**.

A system must be:
1. **Accessible** – No barriers to usage.
2. **Usable** – Minimal effort required to achieve goals.
3. **Acceptable** – Fit for purpose in real-world contexts.

---

## **3. The Three Views of Good Design**
Good design is subjective and depends on context. However, interactive systems designers typically follow **three main perspectives**:

1. **View 1:** Systems should be **accessible, usable, socially, and economically acceptable**.
2. **View 2:** Systems should be **learnable, effective, and accommodating** to diverse users.
3. **View 3:** The **PACT framework (People, Activities, Contexts, Technologies)** should be balanced.

These perspectives ensure that **interactive systems are practical, efficient, and inclusive**.

---

## **4. Accessibility in Interactive Systems**
> *"A system must be accessible before it is usable."*

Accessibility ensures **no user is excluded from using a system**. **Legal regulations**, such as the **UK’s Equality Act 2010** and **Section 508 in the USA**, mandate **software accessibility**.

### **Barriers to Accessibility**
Users can be excluded due to:
1. **Physical Barriers** – Limited mobility, visual impairments.
2. **Conceptual Barriers** – Users failing to develop a mental model of the system.
3. **Economic Barriers** – High costs preventing access.
4. **Cultural Barriers** – Poor localization, misunderstanding of cultural norms.
5. **Social Barriers** – Systems being unavailable at convenient times or places.

### **Overcoming Accessibility Barriers**
There are **two key approaches**:
- **Universal Design ("Design for All")** – Systems should be **usable by everyone** from the outset.
- **Inclusive Design** – Designs should accommodate a **broad range of abilities**.

#### **Example: Accessibility in Modern Systems**
✔ **Voice assistants (Siri, Google Assistant)** support users with limited mobility.  
✔ **Screen readers (NVDA, JAWS)** help visually impaired users navigate digital content.  
✔ **High-contrast modes** improve readability for users with low vision.  

**Key takeaway:** *"If a design works well for people with disabilities, it works better for everyone."*

---

## **5. What Makes a System Usable?**
A system with **high usability** possesses the following characteristics:

1. **Efficiency** – Users complete tasks with **minimum effort**.
2. **Effectiveness** – The system provides **relevant functions and content**.
3. **Learnability** – Users can **quickly grasp how to use** the system.
4. **Safety** – The system **prevents major errors and failures**.
5. **Utility** – The system does what users **expect and need**.

---

## **6. Four Key Principles of Usability**
Usability is **not an afterthought**—it must be **embedded into the design process**. The following principles ensure usability is maintained:

### **1. Early Focus on Users and Tasks**
- Designers must **study user needs and behaviors**.
- **Participative Design:** Users should be involved in **design decisions**.

**Example:**  
✔ **Amazon’s website redesigns** involve extensive **user research and A/B testing**.

### **2. Empirical Measurement**
- Usability should be **measured using real user data**.
- **Testing methods:** User feedback, usability tests, eye-tracking studies.

**Example:**  
✔ **Google’s search algorithm updates** are based on **user interaction data**.

### **3. Iterative Design**
- Design must be **continuously tested and refined**.
- Designers must **fix usability problems** through cycles of **testing and improvement**.

**Example:**  
✔ **Windows 11 UI refinements** came from **iterative user testing and feedback**.

### **4. Integrated Usability**
- Usability must be **holistic**—**all elements of the system** should evolve together.

**Example:**  
✔ **Apple’s ecosystem** (iPhone, iPad, Mac) provides a **seamless, integrated experience**.

---

## **7. Norman’s Usability Model: Bridging the Two Gulfs**
> *"Technology should not get in the way of what people want to do."* – **Don Norman (1988)**

Norman identifies two **“gulfs”** in usability:

1. **Gulf of Execution** – Users struggle to **translate their goals into system actions**.
   - Example: A **TV remote with too many buttons** confuses users.

2. **Gulf of Evaluation** – Users struggle to **determine if their actions were successful**.
   - Example: **Unclear error messages in software** leave users frustrated.

### **Bridging the Gulfs**
To **reduce usability gaps**, designers should:
✔ Use **intuitive icons and labels**.  
✔ Provide **clear feedback** for user actions.  
✔ Ensure **interfaces match user expectations**.  

**Example:**  
✔ **Google Maps** automatically **reroutes users** when they make a wrong turn, **bridging the Gulf of Evaluation**.

---

## **8. Acceptability in Interactive Systems**
> *"Acceptability is about fitting technology into people’s lives."*

### **Key Factors of Acceptability**
1. **Political** – Systems must **comply with laws and ethical standards**.
2. **Convenience** – Users should **find the system easy to integrate** into their routines.
3. **Cultural & Social** – The system must be **sensitive to cultural differences**.
4. **Usefulness** – The system should **solve real-world problems**.
5. **Economic** – Users must **afford and justify** the system’s cost.

**Example:**  
✔ **Digital wallets (Paytm, Google Pay)** are widely adopted due to their **convenience and economic benefits**.

---

## **9. 12 Key Design Principles for Usability**
Usability principles ensure systems are **intuitive, efficient, and error-free**.

### **Learnability: Helping Users Access, Learn, and Remember**
1. **Visibility** – Users should see available options **clearly**.
2. **Consistency** – Interfaces should follow **established patterns**.
3. **Familiarity** – Use **common symbols and terminology**.
4. **Affordance** – Make elements **obviously interactive**.

### **Effectiveness: Ensuring Smooth Interaction**
5. **Navigation** – Provide **clear directions and wayfinding cues**.
6. **Control** – Users should feel in **control** of the system.
7. **Feedback** – Systems should provide **immediate responses** to actions.

### **Safety: Minimizing Errors and Risks**
8. **Recovery** – Allow **undo options and error handling**.
9. **Constraints** – Prevent users from **making invalid actions**.

### **Accommodation: Supporting Different User Needs**
10. **Flexibility** – Provide **multiple ways to complete tasks**.
11. **Style** – Aesthetics should enhance, not distract from usability.
12. **Conviviality** – Interfaces should be **friendly and polite**.

---

## **10. Class Activity**
Students are asked to **identify interactive systems** that align with each **usability principle**.

**Example: Applying Principles to Everyday Systems**
| **Design Principle**  | **Example System** |
|---------------------|----------------|
| **Visibility** | Google Search Bar |
| **Consistency** | Microsoft Office UI |
| **Navigation** | GPS Navigation Systems |
| **Feedback** | Mobile Banking Apps |

---

## **Conclusion**
✔ **Usability is essential for ensuring smooth user interaction.**  
✔ **Accessibility and inclusivity improve overall user experience.**  
✔ **Norman’s model helps designers reduce usability gaps.**  
✔ **Key usability principles guide iterative, user-centered design.**  

By following these principles, **interactive systems can be made efficient, accessible, and enjoyable for all users**.

# **Lecture 5: Experience Design in Interactive Systems**

---

### **1. Overview of the Lecture**
Lecture 5 of *Design of Interactive Systems (DIS)* introduces **Experience Design**, an essential aspect of **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**. Unlike traditional usability-focused design, **experience design aims to create enjoyable, engaging, and memorable interactions** for users.

The lecture explores:
- **User Experience (UX)** – Beyond usability, focusing on **emotions and engagement**.
- **Nathan Shedroff’s Model** – Key elements of **identity, adaptivity, narrative, immersion, and flow**.
- **Gamification & Fun Models** – How **fun and emotions** drive engagement.
- **Designing for Pleasure** – The role of **aesthetics, emotional responses, and product attachment**.

Experience design ensures that interactive products are **not just functional but delightful to use**.

---

## **2. What is Experience Design?**
> *"Designers of interactive systems are increasingly expected to design systems that provide great experiences."*

**Experience Design (XD)** is about creating products that evoke **emotion, engagement, and satisfaction**. 

For example:
✔ A **shopping list app** should not just be **functional**—it should be **fun to use**.  
✔ A **website** should not just display information—it should **keep users engaged**.  

> *"UX design goes beyond usability—it’s about creating interactions that are immersive, engaging, and meaningful."*

### **Aims of Experience Design**
1. Explore **different traditions** influencing experience design.
2. Understand **Nathan Shedroff’s Model** of engagement.
3. Learn **how aesthetics impact experience**.
4. Design for **pleasure, immersion, and long-term attachment**.

---

## **3. Key Factors in Experience Design**
Experience design is **concerned with all the qualities that make an interaction memorable, satisfying, and enjoyable**.

**Examples of engaging experiences:**
- **A good book** pulls the reader into its story.
- **A video game** provides an immersive challenge.
- **A well-designed app** makes users feel in control.

### **Emotion & Experience**
> *"Experience is about feeling."*

- Emotion is **central to experience design**.
- **Users don’t just use a system—they feel something while interacting with it**.
- **Designers can’t create experiences directly**—they can only design **for** experiences.

**Example: Why Apple’s UX is successful**
✔ **MacBooks** feel premium and aesthetically pleasing.  
✔ **iPhones** create a **sense of luxury and exclusivity**.  
✔ **Animations & gestures** provide **smooth, satisfying interactions**.

---

## **4. Nathan Shedroff’s Model of Engagement**
> *"Engagement is about ensuring that interaction flows smoothly."*

Engagement occurs when all **PACT elements** (People, Activities, Contexts, and Technologies) **harmonize**.

**Nathan Shedroff identifies 5 key elements of engagement:**
| **Element** | **Description** | **Example** |
|------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Identity** | Users feel connected to the system, developing a sense of ownership. | Apple vs. Windows users |
| **Adaptivity** | The system adapts to users, offering personalization. | Netflix’s AI-driven recommendations |
| **Narrative** | A compelling story structure keeps users engaged. | Instagram Stories, video games |
| **Immersion** | Users feel completely involved in the experience. | VR gaming, interactive learning |
| **Flow** | Smooth transitions and intuitive actions make interactions seamless. | Swiping gestures on a smartphone |

---

## **5. Gamification & Fun in Interactive Systems**

| **Component** | **Function** |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Sensory Input** | Receives information (vision, hearing, touch). |
| **Information Processing** | Analyzes and interprets data. |
| **Motor Output** | Executes actions (typing, clicking, swiping). |

✔ **Example:**  
- **Using an ATM:**  
  1. **Sensory Input:** Seeing the ATM screen.  
  2. **Processing:** Deciding which button to press.  
  3. **Motor Output:** Pressing the “Withdraw” button.  

✔ **HIP is useful for interface design but has limitations**:
❌ Too **simplistic** – Humans are more than just "information processors."  
❌ **Ignores social and emotional factors** in decision-making.

## **4. Norman’s Seven-Stage Model of Action**
> *"Human actions follow a structured mental process before execution."*

✔ **Seven Stages of Activity:**
| **Stage** | **Example: Checking Sports Results** |
|----------|-------------------------------|
| **1. Goal** | "I want to check match scores." |
| **2. Intention** | "I need to open a sports app." |
| **3. Action Planning** | "I will unlock my phone and tap the app." |
| **4. Execution** | Opens the app, searches for the score. |
| **5. Perception** | Sees the displayed scores. |
| **6. Interpretation** | Understands if their team won. |
| **7. Evaluation** | Decides whether to celebrate or check highlights. |

✔ **Challenges in Execution:**
- **The Gulf of Execution:** Difficulty in performing an action.  
  - Example: **Struggling to find a sports app on a cluttered phone screen.**  
- **The Gulf of Evaluation:** Difficulty in interpreting system feedback.  
  - Example: **Not knowing whether the app is refreshing data or frozen.**  

✔ **Design Tip:**  
- **Reduce cognitive gaps** by making actions and feedback **clear, predictable, and intuitive.**

## **5. Why HIP Alone is Not Enough**
> *"Traditional cognitive models (HIP) do not capture the complexity of human behavior."*

✔ **Limitations of HIP Models:**
❌ **Too simplistic** – Human cognition is not linear.  
❌ **Ignores social context** – People interact with technology socially.  
❌ **Fails to explain real-world problem-solving** – Learning and adaptation play a role.  

✔ **Alternative Cognitive Models:**
- **Distributed Cognition**
- **Embodied Cognition**
- **Activity Theory**  

---

## **6. Distributed Cognition: Thinking Beyond the Brain**
> *"Cognition is shared across people, tools, and environments."*

✔ **Example: The Moon Landing (1969)**
- Astronauts Armstrong and Aldrin **landed on the Moon**, assisted by **Mission Control in Houston**.
- **Cognitive processes were distributed**:
  - **Astronauts** focused on flying.
  - **Ground control** provided navigation guidance.

✔ **Other Examples:**
| **Scenario** | **Distributed Cognition** |
|------------|------------------------|
| **Driving in a new city** | GPS provides directions, passengers assist. |
| **Shopping in a supermarket** | A list + shelf arrangements aid decision-making. |
| **Collaborative work on spreadsheets** | Employees + Excel formulas work together. |

✔ **Design Implication:**  
- Systems should **support collaboration and shared cognitive resources**.  

---

## **7. Embodied Cognition: Thinking with the Body**
> *"Cognition is influenced by physical actions and the environment."*

✔ **Key Concepts:**
- **Physical objects shape thought** (e.g., using an abacus to do math).  
- **Action influences perception** (e.g., feeling the weight of an object before lifting).  
- **People interact with technology through bodily movement.**  

✔ **Example:**  
- **Touchscreens allow direct manipulation**, improving engagement.  

✔ **Design Tip:**  
- **Use natural interactions like swiping, pinching, and dragging.**

## **8. Affordances in Interactive Design**
> *"Affordances are properties of objects that suggest how they should be used."* – Don Norman  

✔ **Examples of Affordances:**
| **Type** | **Example** |
|---------|-------------|
| **Physical Affordance** | A door handle invites pulling. |
| **Cognitive Affordance** | Play icon (▶) suggests clicking. |
| **Perceived Affordance** | Raised buttons look pressable. |

✔ **Design Tip:**  
- **Good UI elements should suggest their function clearly.**  

✔ **Example:**  
- **A shopping cart icon** naturally conveys the function of adding items.  

---

## **9. Activity Theory: Understanding Human Actions**
> *"All human activities involve an interaction between a subject, tools, and an object (goal)."*

✔ **Example: Learning to Drive**
| **Component** | **Example** |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Subject** | A person learning to drive. |
| **Tools** | Steering wheel, pedals, GPS. |
| **Object (Goal)** | Successfully driving on a highway. |

✔ **Activity Breakdown:**
1. **Actions** – Turning the key, shifting gears.  
2. **Operations** – Subconscious habits like checking mirrors.  

✔ **Over time, actions become automatic, reducing cognitive load.**  

✔ **Design Tip:**  
- Design systems that **guide beginners** but also offer **shortcuts for experts**.  

---

## **10. Class Activities**
1. **Identify a device you find difficult to use.**  
   - What **gulf of execution** or **gulf of evaluation** exists?  
2. **Find an example of misleading affordances in daily life.**  
   - How does the design create confusion?
