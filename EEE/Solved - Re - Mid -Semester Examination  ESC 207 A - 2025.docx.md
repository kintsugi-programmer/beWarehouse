1(a). Explain the relationship between genes and heredity.          2                         

1(a).Our chromosomes contain the blueprint for your body – your genes. Almost every cell in the human body contains a copy of this blueprint, mostly stored inside a special sac within the cell called the nucleus. Chromosomes are long strands of a chemical substance called deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).

Parents pass on traits or characteristics, such as eye colour and blood type, to their children through their genes. Some health conditions and diseases can be passed on genetically too.

Sometimes, one characteristic has many different forms. For example, blood type can be A, B, AB or O. Changes (or variations) in the gene for that characteristic cause these different forms.

The two alleles in a gene pair are inherited, one from each parent. Alleles interact with each other in different ways.

The most common interaction between alleles is a dominant/recessive relationship. An allele of a gene is said to be dominant when it effectively overrules the other (recessive) allele.

Eye colour and blood groups are both examples of dominant/recessive gene relationships.

1(b). What is gene editing process?                     2

Genome editing (also called gene editing) is a group of technologies that give scientists the ability to change an organism's DNA. These technologies allow genetic material to be added, removed, or altered at particular locations in the genome. Several approaches to genome editing have been developed.

CRISPR/ Cas9 is a highly effective gene-editing tool that is widely used in the scientific community. The CRISPR/Cas9 system evolved naturally in bacteria and archaea as a defense mechanism against bacterio phage infection and plasmid  (circular DNA) transfer.

Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats  (CRISPR/ Cas9) for  removing, adding or altering sections of the DNA sequence.

An enzyme called Cas9. This acts as a pair of ‘molecular scissors’ that can cut the two strands of DNA at a specific location in the genome and a piece of RNA called guide RNA (gRNA) ‘guides’ Cas9 to the right part of the genome. 

CRISPR has been used to experiment with gene-edited mosquitos to reduce the spread of malaria, for engineering agriculture to withstand climate change, and in human clinical trials to treat a range of diseases, from cancer to transthyretin amyloidosis , a rare protein disorder that devastates nerves and organs.

Genome editing is a specific method of gene therapy. Instead of introducing new genetic material into cells, genome editing involves using molecular tools to modify the existing DNA in a cell. This can help make changes in physical traits such as reducing disease risk.

Scientists can also use genome editing to investigate different conditions that affect humans. They do this by editing the genomes of animals that have similar genes to humans, such as mice and zebrafish. By editing their genome, researchers can observe how these changes affect the animals’ health. E.g., (the body of the zebrafish is almost entirely transparent).

2\. (a). What is epigenetics?                                    2

2 (b). Describe the natural scavangers which keep our environment clean.     1                                  

2 (c). Describe the role of humans as ecological engineers.                              1       

2 (a). Various environmental factors and lifestyle choices can also affect gene activity and expression. This is known as epigenetics.

Epigenetics refers to the study of how cells control gene activity without changing the DNA sequence. Epigenetic changes describe reversible chemical modifications that can activate and deactivate parts of the genome and alter the expression of these genes.

As such, epigenetics describes how a person’s environment and behaviors can affect how their genes work. These changes can increase a person’s risk of genetic damage or disease.

Epigenetics affects gene expression by turning genes on and off. This can refer to genes making proteins where or when they normally would not, or not making proteins where and when they normally would. It can also influence how much or how little of a protein they would normally produce.

One way this can occur is through DNA methylation. This involves the addition of a chemical, known as a methyl (-CH3) group, to DNA. Conversely, the removal of a methyl group is known as demethylation. Usually, methylation turns genes off, which reduces protein production, while demethylation turns them on, increasing the amount of protein a cell makes.

Research suggests that lifestyle practices like yoga and meditation can potentially influence epigenetic processes, modulating gene expression and impacting our health. Stress Response and Telomeres (A telomere is a region of repetitive DNA sequences at the end of a chromosome.).

:Yoga practices have been shown to reduce stress levels and improve the body's stress response.

A muscle cell has a structure that aids in your body's ability to move. Epigenetics allows the muscle cell to turn on genes to make proteins important for its job and turn off genes important for a nerve cell's job.

Exercise induces profound alterations in epigenetics in multiple tissues. Exercise induces alterations in histone modification, DNA/RNA methylation, and non-coding RNA expression in multiple tissues, which underlies its beneficial effects on health promotion and disease prevention.

Hence, physical activity has been found to induce changes in DNA methylation patterns as well as expression of corresponding genes in skeletal muscle, both in response to a single exercise bout and after prolonged exercise training.

 Yog Guru Ramdev or other yoga programs?

The human body was made to be in constant movement. Walking is therefore the nature of man as a biological being.

 It is believed that Walking is good for health.

**2 (b)**.Some land scavengers include bears, hyenas, jackals, and wolves. Scavengers such as vultures, crows, ravens, and condors are found in the air. In water, lobsters, crabs, and some species of shark are considered scavengers. Vulture, white shark, Jungle Crow, polar bear are other scavangers. 

Biologically, the best sense is that we started out as scavengers. We definely were omnivores, and, before we had tools, we were not really strong enough to take down live prey of any size.

Ecology helps in maintaining the world rich in resources with assuring the balance through natural interaction of different organisms. Some of the importance of ecology is maintaining a clean environment, ensuring resources like land and water, and helping the ecosystem adapt to climate change.

**2(c)**

Humans are the most evident ecological engineers on the Earth, since they modify their environment also with the help of technology. Although all species affect their physical environment among them are species that can modulate the availability of resources to other species by modifying, maintaining or creating habitats. \\

in other words, by creating synergies with other species. The difference between humans and the other ecological engineers is the intent behind human actions 

with possible unexpected negative consequences, while other ecological engineer species often provide directly or indirectly essential ecosystem services for

human well-being. In this context, there is the  example of birds as ecological engineers that are able to deliver provisioning, regulating, cultural and supporting ecosystem services as the ecosystem engineers through  changing  the environment by transforming living or non-living materials from one physical state to another. 

3(a). What are viruses and what diseases do these cause?                      2                                       

3(b). Why Dynosaurs were not as intelligent as human beings  today are with AI, ML, Blockchains?                                                                               2

**3 (a).** A virus is an infectious microbe consisting of a segment of nucleic acid (either DNA or RNA) surrounded by a protein coat. A virus cannot replicate alone; instead, it must infect cells and use components of the host cell to make copies of itself. Human Metapneumovirus (HMPVvirus – China – 2025).

Some common types of viruses that you might hear about include: Influenza viruses. Human herpesviruses. Coronavirus..

Viruses are not made out of cells, they can't keep themselves in a stable state, they don't grow, and they can't make their own energy. Even though they definitely replicate and adapt to their environment, viruses are more like androids than real living organisms.

**3(b).** Necessity is the mother of inventions. Remember that intelligence is incredibly expensive. Your brain burns almost a quarter of all the energy you eat. So it had better give you a really big lift in your daily energy supply, otherwise you are doomed.

Take dinosaurs for instance. Cold blooded herbivores and carnivores, each sub species developed the tools and skills to survive for hundreds of millions of years. Claws, fangs, long necks to reach the high vegetation, horns and clubbed tails to defend against predators. That’s what was urgently needed in their environment and in relation to the competition. In that situation, soft skills like vocal chords and opposable thumbs would not have helped anyone make it through the night against a pack of hungry Velociraptors.

Then, one day (thankfully for us) came a huge meteorite impact \- a mass extinction type.

And why did our brain grow bigger than what the other apes got along fine with? Because the gene that was supposed to tell our nerve cells when to stop replicating stopped working. It was a malfunction, a breakdown. But by an incredible stroke of luck, these defective apes just happened to be on the edge of a new situation.

 where unnecessarily many nerve cells could be put to good use. And here we are.

In this new era different types of skillsets can also be relevant to survival of the species. Now, it is not only about claws and fangs (they remain a favorite) but a certain miserable primate with rather complex vocal chords and opposable thumbs suddenly has a chance. Of all its stronger primate cousins, that is the one that eventually stands up and travels distances, again to adapt to environmental conditions. Its hand anatomy, originally developed to climb trees, helps it make tools and, most importantly, start a fire. Consequently, this guy and his friends lose the fur. Which in turn, frees up a lot of their time (see how primates spend most their day removing parasites from each others fur), not to mention rids them of bloodsuckers that tend to decrease one’s life expectancy. They gather round the fire every night and their vocal chords evolve even more. They communicate effectively and their hunting strategies become lethal against much larger animals. And all along their brains grow bigger and better at tackling these challenges. Until finally, we got to the iPad. All through natural selection.

Funny thing is, had these weaklings started out stronger and better armed they probably would not have developed any of that, which in the end proved vastly superior to claws and fangs.

And this is why dinos were around for about 160 million years yet they never built an iPad.

\\ Environment, circumstances, chance, accidental, incidental changes and then several genetic mutations, adaptations and  necessities , climate changes, natural selections etc. led to the modern human brain

4 (a).  What is genetic mutation? Explain with examples.                        2

4 (b).What are chemical, physical and biological mutagens ?                   2

**4(a)**. Genetic mutations are changes to your DNA sequence that happen during cell division when your cells make copies of themselves. Your DNA tells your body how to form and function. Genetic mutations could lead to genetic conditions like cancer, or they could help humans better adapt to their environment over time.

Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence of a cell's genome and are the ultimate source of genetic variation in all organisms.

When mutations occur, they may alter the product of a gene, or prevent the gene from functioning, or have no effect.

New genes can be generated from an ancestral gene when a duplicate copy mutates and acquires a new function. This process is easier once a gene has been duplicated because it increases the redundancy of the system; one gene in the pair can acquire a new function while the other copy continues to perform its original function.

Other types of mutations can even generate entirely new genes from previously noncoding DNA, a phenomenon termed de novo gene birth.

One example of mutation is wild boar piglets. They are camouflage colored and show a characteristic pattern of dark and light longitudinal stripes. However, mutations in melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) disrupt the pattern. The majority of pig breeds carry MC1R mutations disrupting wild-type color and different mutations causing dominant black color of the pigs.

Anything that causes a mutation (a change in the DNA of a cell). DNA changes caused by mutagens may harm cells and cause certain diseases, such as cancer. Examples of mutagens include radioactive substances, x-rays, ultraviolet radiation, and certain chemicals.

**4 (b).**

Examples of chemical mutagens that are base analogs include 5-Bromouracil and 2-Aminopurine, ethyl methanesulfonate or N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea etc.

Physical mutagens include electromagnetic radiation, such as gamma rays, X rays, and UV light, and particle radiation, such as fast and thermal neutrons, beta and alpha particles. Mutagenic treatment of seeds is the most convenient and, therefore, the standard method in seed propagated crops.

Biological mutagens consist of bacteria and viruses capable of producing mutations in DNA. Human papillomavirus (HPV), for example, results in long-term infection in individuals unable to clear the virus from their bodies.

5(b). Sequencing of complete genome.

Artificial intelligence in  genetic manipulations ?

AI is a powerful tool for creating new hypotheses and helping with experimental techniques. From the previous data of a gene model, it can help in the detection of heredity and gene-related disorders. AI developments offer an excellent possibility for rational drug discovery and design, eventually impacting humanity. 

 AI has significantly aided in the treatment of various biomedical conditions, including genetic disorders. In both basic and applied gene research, deep learning \- a highly versatile branch of AI that enables autonomous feature extraction \- is increasingly exploited.

In 2017, fetal researchers at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia published a study showing they had grown premature lamb fetuses for four weeks in an extra-uterine life support system. A 14-day rule prevents human embryos from being kept in artificial wombs longer than 14 days; this rule has been codified into law in twelve countries.

An artificial womb is not designed to replace a pregnant person; it could not be used from conception until birth. Rather, it could be used to help a small number of infants born before 28 weeks of pregnancy, which is considered extreme prematurity. Less than 1% of babies are born this early.
