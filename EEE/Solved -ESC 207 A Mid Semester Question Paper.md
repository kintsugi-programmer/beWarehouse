                                                     Attempt all the questions 

**1.(a).Why did human evolve with 5 fingers ?**

**There is  a five finger option or understanding of the five processes  of evolution — small population, non-random mating, mutations, gene flow, adaptation .** 

**This has impacted the  evolution (ie. the changes in the gene pool of a population from generation to generation)**

**About 380 million years ago, quadrupedalism ( four limbs)  can have six, seven even eight fingers depending on different species. Due to evolution, it has been simplified into a five-finger structure which ensure both the flexibility and the grasping ability. This is the reason why we all have five fingers not six or four.**

**Quadrupedalism is a form of locomotion where four limbs are used to bear weight and move around. An animal or machine that usually maintains a four-legged posture.**

**(b). Is the evolution of human, animals and insects still happening?** 

 **If yes, then what are the chances that this would lead to the extinction of life on this terrestrial ball if sufficient attention on this aspect is  not given.**

**(2+2)**

**Human evolution is still happening on this earth.This includes AI, ML etc. ansd of course space applications. Emdergence of new diseases and their cure etc.**

**These evolutions are also presenting newer challenges to the very existence of human life on this earth. Every organism has its role on this earth and if these organisms become extinct then  the earth would be littrered with waste, carcasses etc. Global warming and mitigation of climate change and the stockpile of nuclear arsenals and the accumulation of nuclear , hazardous and other wastes are other problems challkeging the very existence of human life on earth.**

**2 .(a)Why did human beings lose their tails?**

**The loss of the tail is inferred to have occurred around 25 million years ago when the hominoid lineage diverged from the ancient Old World monkeys, leaving only 3–5 caudal vertebrae to form the coccyx  or tailbone, in modern humans**

**(b)	What are anaerobic, aerobic, facultative bacteria?** 

**(c).What are extremophiles?**

**Anaerobic bacteria are germs that can survive and grow where there is no oxygen. For example, it can thrive in human tissue that is injured and does not have oxygen-rich blood flowing to it. Infections like tetanus and gangrene are caused by anaerobic bacteria.**

**Aerobic bacteria:An aerobic organism or aerobe is an organism that can survive and grow in an oxygenated environment.**

**Aerobic Bacteria Examples: Some examples of aerobic bacteria are Nocardia sp. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E. Coli, Citrobacter, Klebsiella, Proteus, Salmonella, Achromobacter Mycobacterium tuberculosis etc.**

**Facultative Bacteria that can use dissolved oxygen (DO) or oxygen obtained from food materials such as sulfate or nitrate ions, or some can respire through glycolysis. The bacteria can live under aerobic, anoxic, or anaerobic conditions.**

**(c) extremophiles \-Organisms surviving in ice cold and other extreme conditions.**

**Chemoautotrophic bacteria  Use CO2 instead of carbohydrates as their carbon substrates.- Acidithiobacillus ferrooxodans.**

**(1+2+1)**

 **3(a). Why are carnivores  essential for balancing the natural life in forests ?**

**Explain by giving example of the incidence that had occurred earlier in Yellowstone National Park,  USA.**

**3 (b).What are PFAS and Microplastics?**

**(2+2)**

**The creation of the national park did not provide protection for wolves or other predators, and government predator control programs in the first decades of the 1900s essentially helped eliminate the gray wolf from Yellowstone. The last wolves were killed in Yellowstone in 1926\.**

**From 1995 to 1997, 41 wild wolves from Canada and northwest Montana were released in Yellowstone.** 

**Wolf reintroduction caused unanticipated change in Yellowstone. It rebalanced elk and deer populations, allowing the willows and aspen to return to the landscape. The end to overgrazing stabilized riverbanks and rivers recovered and flowed in new directions. Songbirds returned as did beavers, eagles, foxes and badgers.**

**3 (b).What are PFAS and Microplastics?**

**They are ingredients in various everyday products. For example, PFAS are used to keep food from sticking to packaging or cookware, make clothes and carpets.**

**It is currently known that three treatment processes can be effective for PFAS removal: granular activated carbon, ion exchange resins, and high-pressure membrane system.**

**Most plastics in the ocean break up into very small particles. These small plastic bits are called "microplastics." Other plastics are intentionally designed to be small. They're called microbeads and are used in many health and beauty products. They pass unchanged hrough waterways into the ocean.**

**4 (a).What are divergent origin/ evolution  and convergent origin/ evolution?**

**Homologous structures imply divergent  evolution (Similar origin but different function).**

**Analogous structures imply convergent**  

 **evolution ( Similar function but different origin)**

**or**

**Divergent evolution is when individuals in one species, or closely related species, acquire enough variations in their traits that it leads to two distinct new species. Convergent evolution on the other hand is when two unrelated species develop similar traits because they live in similar environments.**

 

**4(b).  What do you understand by microevolution and macroevolution?**

**Organisms can also respond to selection by cooperating with each other, usually by aiding their relatives or engaging in mutually beneficial symbiosis.**

**In the longer term, evolution produces new species through splitting ancestral populations of organisms into new groups that cannot or will not interbreed. These outcomes of evolution are distinguished based on time scale as macroevolution versus microevolution.**

**Macroevolution refers to evolution that occurs at or above the level of species, in particular speciation and extinction,e.g.,** 

 **Evolution of bat wings and loss of limbs in snakes and lizards.**

**Microevolution refers to smaller evolutionary changes within a species or population, in particular shifts in allele frequency and adaptation,**

 **e.g.,  \- Bacterial strains that have acquired antibiotic resistance. Pesticide resistance, herbicide resistance, and antibiotic resistance are all examples of microevolution by natural selection.** 

**In this sense, microevolution and macroevolution might involve selection at different levels—with microevolution acting on genes and organisms, versus macroevolutionary processes such as species selection acting on entire species and affecting their rates of speciation and extinction homo sapiens from apes i.e., Homo habilis, Homo rudolfensis and Homo erectus.**

**To clarify further, if you're looking at humans, the changing frequencies of certain alleles (gene variants) from generation to generation might be considered microevolution,** 

**while questions of how different species of humans are related and have evolved from one another would be considered macroevolution.**

**5\.** **(a). What is the difference between vertical and horizontal gene transfer?**

**Give examples of horizontal gene transfer.**

**(2+2)**

**Vertical gene transfer is the normal gene transfer between the parents and progeny.**

**Horizontal gene transfer is the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another organism that is not its offspring; this is most common among bacteria. In medicine, this contributes to the spread of antibiotic resistance, as when one bacteria acquires resistance genes it can rapidly transfer them to other species.**

**Horizontal transfer of genes from bacteria to eukaryotes such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the adzuki bean weevil ( Bhaneara  in Hindi) Callosobruchus chinensis has occurred. An example of larger-scale transfers are the eukaryotic bdelloid rotifers (  Microscopic Omnivers – Wheel animals) , which have received a range of genes from bacteria, fungi and plants. Viruses can also carry DNA between organisms, allowing transfer of genes even across biological domains.**

**Horizontal gene transfer ( HGT) occurs in various ways in multi-cellular organisms. For example, in plants, HGT can operate via natural factors, such as host-parasite connection. The parasite acts as a vector transferring mitochondrial genes among two diverse plant species.**

**Horizontal gene transfer also plays a role in the spread of virulence factors, such as exotoxins and exoenzymes, amongst bacteria. A prime example concerning the spread of exotoxins is the adaptive evolution of Shiga toxins in E. coli through horizontal gene transfer via transduction with Shigella species of bacteria.**

**3\. Wastewater treatment.**

**4.Air pollution control- Bioremediation of air pollutants by exploiting the potentials of plant leaves and leaf-associated microbes.**

**5.Over expression of genes –Excessive expression of a gene (as that caused by increasing the frequency of transcription).
