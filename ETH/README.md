			- Do not open suspicious emails and file attachments received from unknown senders. There is a high likelihood that you will allow a virus, freeware, or spyware onto the computer. Do not open unknown websites linked in spam mail messages, retrieved by search engines, or displayed in pop-up windows because they may mislead you into downloading spyware.
			- Enable a firewall to enhance the security level of your computer.
			- Regularly update the software and use a firewall with outbound protection.
			- Regularly check Task Manager and MS Configuration Manager reports.
			- Regularly update virus definition files and scan the system for spyware.
			- Install anti-spyware software. Anti-spyware is the first line of defense against spyware. This software prevents spyware from installing on your system. It periodically scans and protects your system from spyware.
			- Keep your OS up to date.
				- Windows users should periodically perform a Windows or Microsoft update.
				- For users of other OSs or software products, refer to the information given by the OS vendors, and take essential steps against any vulnerability identified.
			- Perform web surfing safely and download cautiously.
				- Before downloading any software, ensure that it is from a trusted website. Read the license agreement, security warning, and privacy statements associated with the software thoroughly to gain a clear understanding before downloading it. 
				- Before downloading freeware or shareware from a website, ensure that the site is safe. Likewise, be cautious with software programs obtained through P2P fileswapping software. Before installing such programs, perform a scan using antispyware software.
			- Do not use administrative mode unless it is necessary, because it may execute malicious programs such as spyware in administrator mode. Consequently, attackers may take complete control of your system.
			- Do not download free music files, screensavers, or emoticons from the Internet because when you do, there is a possibility that are downloading spyware along with them.
			- Beware of pop-up windows or web pages. Never click anywhere on the windows that display messages such as “your computer may be infected,” or claim that they can help your computer to run faster. If you click on such windows, your system may become infected with spyware.
			- Carefully read all disclosures, including the license agreement and privacy statement, before installing any application.

			- Install professional firewall software and anti-keylogging software.
			- Recognize phishing emails and delete them.
			- Regularly update and patch system software.
			- Do not click on links in unsolicited or dubious emails that may direct you to malicious sites.
			- Use keystroke interference software that insert randomized characters into every keystroke.
			- Antivirus and anti-spyware software can detect any installed software, but it is better to detect these programs before installation. Scan the files thoroughly before installing them onto the computer and use a registry editor or process explorer to check for keystroke loggers.
			- Use the Windows on-screen keyboard accessibility utility to enter a password or any other confidential information. Use your mouse to enter any information such as passwords and credit card numbers into the fields, by using your mouse instead of typing the passwords with the keyboard. This will ensure that your information is confidential.
			- Use an automatic form-filling password manager or a virtual keyboard to enter usernames and passwords, as this will avoid exposure through keyloggers. This automatic form-filling password manager will remove the need to type your personal, financial, or confidential details such as credit card numbers and passwords via the keyboard.
			- Keep your hardware systems secure in a locked environment and frequently check the keyboard cables for attached connectors, USB port, and computer games such as the PS2 that may have been used to install keylogger software.
			- Use software that frequently scan and monitor changes in your system or network.
			- Install a host-based IDS, which can monitor your system and disable the installation of keyloggers.
			- Use one-time password (OTP) or other authentication mechanisms such as two-step or multi-step verification to authenticate users.
			- Enable application whitelisting to block downloading or installing of unwanted software such as keyloggers.
			- Use VPN to enable an additional layer of protection through encryption.
			- Use process-monitoring tools to detect suspicious processes and system activities.

	- Vulnerability Research
		- The process of analyzing protocols, services, and configurations to discover vulnerabilities and design flaws that will expose an operating system and its applications to exploit, attack, or misuse
		- Vulnerabilities are classified based on severity level (low, medium, or high) and exploit range (local or remote)

		- An administrator needs vulnerability research:
			- To gather information about security trends, newly discovered threats, attack surfaces, attack vectors and techniques
			- To find weaknesses in the OS and applications and alert the network administrator before a network attack
			- To understand information that helps prevent security problems
			- To know how to recover from a network attack

	- What is Vulnerability Assessment?
		- Vulnerability assessment is an in-depth examination of the ability of a system or application, including current security procedures and controls, to withstand the exploitation
		- It recognizes, measures, and classifies security vulnerabilities in a computer system, network, and communication channels
		- A vulnerability assessment may be used to:
			- Identify weaknesses that could be exploited
			- Predict the effectiveness of additional security measures in protecting information resources from attack
		- Limitations of Vulnerability Assessment
			- Vulnerability-scanning software is limited in its ability to detect vulnerabilities at a given point in time
			- Vulnerability-scanning software must be updated when new vulnerabilities are discovered or when improvements are made to the software being used
			- Software is only as effective as the maintenance performed on it by the software vendor and by the administrator who uses it
			- Vulnerability Assessment does not measure the strength of security controls
			- Vulnerability-scanning software itself is not immune to software engineering flaws that might lead to it missing serious vulnerabilities
			- Human judgment is needed to analyze the data after scanning and identifying the false positives and false negatives.

	- Information Obtained from the Vulnerability Scanning
		- The OS version running on computers or devices
		- IP and Transmission Control Protocol/User Datagram Protocol (TCP/UDP) ports that are listening
		- Applications installed on computers
		- Accounts with weak passwords
		- Files and folders with weak permissions
		- Default services and applications that might have to be uninstalled
		- Errors in the security configuration of common applications
		- Computers exposed to known or publicly reported vulnerabilities
		- EOL/EOS software information
		- Missing patches and hotfixes
		- Weak network configurations and misconfigured or risky ports
		- Help to verify the inventory of all devices on the network

	- Vulnerability Scanning Approaches
		- Active Scanning 
			- The attacker interacts directly with the target network to find vulnerabilities
			- Example: An attacker sends probes and specially crafted requests to the target host in the network to identify vulnerabilities
		- Passive Scanning
			- The attacker tries to find vulnerabilities without directly interacting with the target network
			- Example: An attacker guesses the operating system information, applications, and application and service versions by observing the TCP connection setup and teardown

	- Vulnerability Scoring Systems and Databases
		- Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) https://www.first.org https://nvd.nist.gov
			- An open framework for communicating the characteristics and impacts of IT vulnerabilities
			- Its quantitative model ensures repeatable accurate measurement, while enabling users to view the underlying vulnerability characteristics used to generate the scores
		- Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) https://cve.mitre.org
			- A publicly available and free-to-use list or dictionary of standardized identifiers for common software vulnerabilities and exposures
		- National Vulnerability Database (NVD) https://nvd.nist.gov
			- A U.S. government repository of standards based vulnerability management data represented using the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)
			- These data enable the automation of vulnerability management, security measurement, and compliance
			- The NVD includes databases of security checklist references, security-related software flaws, misconfigurations, product names, and impact metrics
		- Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) https://cwe.mitre.org
			- A category system for software vulnerabilities and weaknesses
			- It is sponsored by the National Cybersecurity FFRDC, which is owned by The MITRE Corporation, with support from US-CERT and the National Cyber Security Division of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security
			- It has over 600 categories of weaknesses, which enable CWE to be effectively employed by the community as a baseline for weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts

# Module 04: Password Cracking Techniques and Countermeasures 
- Password Cracking Techniques 
	- Password cracking techniques are used to recover passwords from computer systems
	- Attackers use password cracking techniques to gain unauthorized access to vulnerable systems
	- Most of the password cracking techniques are successful because of weak or easily guessable passwords

	- Password Complexity
		- Passwords that contain letters, special characters, and numbers: ap1@52
		- Passwords that contain only numbers: 23698217
		- Passwords that contain only special characters: &*#@!(%)
		- Passwords that contain letters and numbers: meet123
		- Passwords that contain only letters: POTHMYDE
		- Passwords that contain only letters and special characters: bob@&ba
		- Passwords that contain only special characters and numbers: 123@$45
		- Passwords that contain only uppercase and lowercase letters, such as: RuNnEr
		- Passwords that contain more than 20 characters comprising a phrase: such as Hardtocrackveryeasily
		- Passwords that contain shortcut codes or acronyms, such as L8r_L8rNot2day (i.e., later, later, not today)
		- Passwords that contain frequently used words specifying websites, such as ABT2_uz_AMZ! (i.e., about to use Amazon!)
		- Passwords that contain the first letters of words of a long sentence, such as TffcievwMi16wiwdm5g (i.e., the first foreign country I ever visited was Mexico in 2016 when I was doing my 5th grade)

	- Microsoft Authentication
		- Security Accounts Manager (SAM) Database
			- Windows stores user passwords in SAM, or in the Active Directory database in domains
			- Passwords are never stored in clear text and are hashed, and the results are stored in the SAM
		- NTLM Authentication
			- The NTLM authentication protocol types are as follows: NTLM authentication protocol and LM authentication protocol
			- These protocols store the user’s password in the SAM database using different hashing methods
		- Kerberos Authentication
			- Microsoft has upgraded its default authentication protocol to Kerberos which provides a stronger authentication for client/server applications than NTLM

	- Types of Password Attacks
		- Non-Electronic Attacks
			- The attacker does not need technical knowledge to crack the password, hence it is known as a non-technical attack
				- Shoulder Surfing
				- Social Engineering
				- Dumpster Diving
		- Active Online Attacks
			- The attacker performs password cracking by directly communicating with the victim’s machine
				- Dictionary, Brute Forcing, and Rule-based Attack
				- Hash Injection Attack
				- LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning
				- Trojan/Spyware/Keyloggers
				- Password Guessing
		- Passive Online Attacks 
			- The attacker performs password cracking without communicating with the authorizing party
				- Wire Sniffing
				- Man-in-the-Middle Attack
				- Replay Attack
		- Offline Attacks
			- The attacker copies the target’s password file and then tries to crack passwords on his own system at a different location
				- Rainbow Table Attack (Pre-Computed Hashes)
				- Distributed Network Attack

	- Dictionary, Brute-Force, and Rule-based Attack
		- Dictionary Attack
			- A dictionary file is loaded into the cracking application that runs against user accounts
		- Brute-Force Attack
			- The program tries every combination of characters until the password is broken
		- Rule-based Attack
			- This attack is used when the attacker gets some information about the password

	- Password Guessing
		- The attacker creates a list of all possible passwords from the information collected through social engineering or any other way and manually inputs them on the victim’s machine to crack the passwords
		- The following are the steps involved in password guessing:
			- Find a valid user
			- Create a list of possible passwords
			- Rank passwords from high to low probability
			- Key in each password, until the correct password is discovered

	- Default Passwords
		- A default password is a password supplied by the manufacturer with new equipment (e.g., switches, hubs, routers) that is password protected
		- Attackers use default passwords present in the list of words or dictionary to perform password guessing attack
		- Online Tools to Search Default Passwords
			- https://open-sez.me
			- https://www.fortypoundhead.com
			- https://cirt.net
			- http://www.defaultpassword.us
			- https://www.routerpasswords.com
			- https://default-password.info

	- Trojans/Spyware/Keyloggers
		- The attacker installs a Trojan/Spyware/Keylogger on the victim's machine to collect the victim's usernames and passwords
		- The Trojan/Spyware/Keylogger runs in the background and sends back all user credentials to the attacker

	- Hash Injection/Pass-the-Hash (PtH) Attack
		- A hash injection/PtH attack allows an attacker to inject a compromised hash into a local session and use the hash to validate network resources
		- The attacker finds and extracts a logged-on domain admin account hash
		- The attacker uses the extracted hash to log on to the domain controller

	- LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning
		- LLMNR and NBT-NS are the two main elements of Windows operating systems that are used to perform name resolution for hosts present on the same link
		- The attacker cracks the NTLMv2 hash obtained from the victim’s authentication process
		- The extracted credentials are used to log on to the host system in the network

	- Pass the Ticket Attack
		- Pass the Ticket is a technique used for authenticating a user to a system that is using Kerberos without providing the user’s password
		- To perform this attack, the attacker dumps Kerberos tickets of legitimate accounts using credential dumping tools
		- The attacker then launches a pass the ticket attack either by stealing the ST/TGT from an end-user machine, or by stealing the ST/TGT from a compromised Authorization Server
		- The attacker uses the retrieved ticket to gain unauthorized access to the target network services
		- Tools such as Mimikatz, Rubeus, and Windows Credentials Editor are used by attackers to launch such attacks
	
	- Wire Sniffing
		- Attackers run packet sniffer tools on the local area network (LAN) to access and record the raw network traffic
		- The captured data may include sensitive information such as passwords (FTP, rlogin sessions, etc.) and emails
		- Sniffed credentials are used to gain unauthorized access to the target system

	- Man-in-the-Middle and Replay Attacks
		- In an MITM attack, the attacker acquires access to the communication channels between the victim and the server to extract the information needed
		- In a replay attack, packets and authentication tokens are captured using a sniffer. After the relevant information is extracted, the tokens are placed back on the network to gain access

	- Rainbow Table Attack
		- Rainbow Table
			- A precomputed table that contains word lists like dictionary files, brute force lists, and their hash values
		- Compare the Hashes
			- The hash of passwords is captured and compared with the precomputed hash table. If a match is found, then the password gets cracked
		- Easy to Recover
			- It is easy to recover passwords by comparing the captured password hashes to the precomputed tables

- Password Cracking Tools 
	- L0phtCrack https://www.l0phtcrack.com
		- A tool designed to audit passwords and recover applications
	- ophcrack https://ophcrack.sourceforge.io

	- John the Ripper https://www.openwall.com
	- hashcat https://hashcat.net
	- THC-Hydra https://github.com
	- Medusa http://foofus.net

- Password Cracking Countermeasures 
	- Disallow use of the same password during a password change 
	- Disallow password sharing
	- Disallow the use of passwords that can be found in a dictionary
	- Do not use cleartext protocols and protocols with weak encryption
	- Set the password change policy to 30 days 
	- Do not use any system default passwords
	- Make passwords hard to guess by requiring 8-12 alphanumeric characters consisting of a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols
	- Ensure that applications neither store passwords in memory nor write them to disks in clear text
	- Use a random string (salt) as a prefix or suffix to the password before encryption
	- Disallow the use of passwords such as date of birth, spouse, child’s, or pet’s name
	- Lockout an account subjected to too many incorrect password guesses
	- Use two-factor or multi-factor authentication, for example, using CAPTCHA to prevent automated attacks


# Module 05: Social Engineering Techniques and Countermeasures 
- Social Engineering Concepts and its Phases 
	- Social engineering is the art of convincing people to reveal confidential information
	- Social engineers depend on the fact that people are unaware of the valuable information to which they have access and are careless about protecting it

	- Common Targets of Social Engineering
		- Receptionists and Help-Desk Personnel
		- Technical Support Executives
		- System Administrators
		- Users and Clients
		- Vendors of the Target Organization

		- Lack of Security Policies

	- Why is Social Engineering Effective?
		- Social engineering does not deal with network security issues; instead, it deals with the psychological manipulation of a human being to extract desired information
			- Security policies are as strong as their weakest link, and human behavior is the most susceptible factor
			- It is difficult to detect social engineering attempts
			- There is no method that can be applied to ensure complete security from social engineering attacks
			- There is no specific software or hardware to defend against a social engineering attack

	- Phases of a Social Engineering Attack
		- Research the Target Company
			- Dumpster diving, websites, employees, tour of the company, etc.
		- Select a Target
			- Identify frustrated employees of the target company
		- Develop a Relationship
			- Develop a relationship with the selected employees

		- SMiShing messages are generally crafted to provoke an instant action from the victim, requiring them to divulge their personal information and account details

- Insider Threats and Identity Theft 
	- Insider Threats/Insider Attacks
		- An insider is any employee (trusted person or people) who have access to critical assets of an organization
		- An insider attack involves using privileged access to intentionally violate rules or cause threat to the organization’s information or information systems in any form
		- Such attacks are generally performed by a privileged user, disgruntled employee, terminated employee, accidentprone employee, third party, undertrained staff, etc.

	- Reasons for Insider Attacks

			- Harmful insiders who use their technical knowledge to identify weaknesses and vulnerabilities in the company’s network and sell confidential information to competitors or black-market bidders
		- Compromised Insider
			- An insider with access to critical assets of an organization who is compromised by an outside threat actor

	- Why are Insider Attacks Effective?
		- Insider attacks are easy to launch.
		- Preventing insider attacks is difficult; an inside attacker can easily succeed.
		- It is very difficult to differentiate harmful actions from the employee’s regular work. It is hard to identify whether employees are performing malicious activities or not.
		- Even after malicious activity is detected, the employee may refuse to accept responsibility and claim it was a mistake.

# Module 06: Network Level Attacks and Countermeasures 

- Sniffing. 
- Packet Sniffing Concepts 
	- Packet sniffing is the process of monitoring and capturing all data packets passing through a given network using a software application or hardware device
	- It allows an attacker to observe and access the entire network traffic from a given point in order to gather sensitive information such as Telnet passwords, email traffic, syslog traffic, etc.
	- How a Sniffer Works
		- A sniffer turns the NIC of a system to the promiscuous mode so that it listens to all the data transmitted on its segment
	- Types of Sniffing
		- Passive Sniffing
			- Passive sniffing refers to sniffing through a hub, wherein the traffic is sent to all ports
			- It involves monitoring packets sent by others without sending any additional data packets in the network traffic
		- Active Sniffing
			- Active sniffing is used to sniff a switch-based network
			- It involves injecting Address Resolution Packets (ARP) into the network to flood the switch’s Content Addressable Memory (CAM) table, which keeps track of host-port connections
			- Active Sniffing Techniques
				- MAC Flooding
				- DNS Poisoning
				- ARP Poisoning
				- DHCP Attacks
				- Switch Port Stealing
				- Spoofing Attack

	- How an Attacker Hacks the Network Using Sniffers
		- An attacker connects his desktop/laptop to a switch port 
		- He/she identifies a victim’s machine to target his/her attacks
		- The traffic destined for the victim’s machine is redirected to the attacker
		- He/she runs discovery tools to learn about network topology
		- He/she poisons the victim’s machine by using ARP spoofing techniques
		- The hacker extracts passwords and sensitive data from the redirected traffic

	- Protocols Vulnerable to Sniffing
		- Telnet and Rlogin 
			- Keystrokes including usernames and passwords are sent in clear text
		- HTTP
			- Data is sent in clear text
		- POP
			- Passwords and data are sent in clear text
		- IMAP
			- Passwords and data are sent in clear text
		- SMTP and NNTP
			- Passwords and data are sent in clear text
		- FTP
			- Passwords and data are sent in clear text

- Sniffing Techniques 
	- MAC flooding
		- MAC flooding involves the flooding of the CAM table with fake MAC address and IP pairs until it is full
		- The switch then acts as a hub by broadcasting packets to all machines on the network, and therefore, the attackers can sniff the traffic easily
		- Mac Flooding Switches with macof https://www.monkey.org
			- macof is a Unix/Linux tool that floods the switch’s CAM tables (131,000 per min) by sending bogus MAC entries

	- DHCP starvation attack
		- DHCP is a configuration protocol that assigns valid IP addresses to host systems out of a pre-assigned DHCP pool
		- DHCP starvation attack is a process of inundating DHCP servers with fake DHCP requests and using all the available IP addresses
		- This results in a denial-of-service attack, where the DHCP server cannot issue new IP addresses to genuine host requests
		
	- ARP Spoofing Attack
		- Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a protocol used for mapping an IP address to a physical machine address which is recognized in the local network
		- ARP spoofing/poisoning involves sending a large number of forged entries to the target machine’s ARP cache
		- ARP Poisoning Tools
			- arpspoof https://linux.die.net 
				- arpspoof –i [Interface] –t [Target Host]
				- arpspoof redirects packets from a target host (or all hosts) on the LAN intended for another host on the LAN by forging ARP replies
			- BetterCAP (https://www.bettercap.org)
			- Ettercap (http://www.ettercap-project.org)
			- dsniff (https://www.monkey.org)
			- MITMf (https://github.com)
			- Arpoison (https://sourceforge.net)

	- MAC spoofing/Duplicating
		- A MAC duplicating attack is launched by sniffing a network for MAC addresses of clients who are actively associated with a switch port and re-using one of those addresses
		- By listening to the traffic on the network, a malicious user can intercept and use a legitimate user's MAC address to receive all the traffic destined for the user
		- This attack allows an attacker to gain access to the network and take over someone’s identity on the network

	- DNS poisoning attacks 
		- Domain Name Server (DNS) poisoning is the unauthorized manipulation of IP addresses in the DNS cache
		- A corrupted DNS redirects a user request to a malicious website to perform illegal activities

	- Sniffing tools
		- Wireshark https://www.wireshark.org
			- Wireshark lets you capture and interactively browse the traffic running on a computer network
		- SteelCentral Packet Analyzer https://www.riverbed.com
		- Capsa Network Analyzer https://www.colasoft.com
		- Observer Analyzer https://www.viavisolutions.com
		- PRTG Network Monitor https://www.paessler.com
		- SolarWinds Deep Packet Inspection and Analysis https://www.solarwinds.com

- Sniffing Countermeasures 
	- Restrict physical access to the network media to ensure that a packet sniffer cannot be installed
	- Use end-to-end encryption to protect confidential information
	- Permanently add the MAC address of the gateway to the ARP cache
	- Use static IP addresses and ARP tables to prevent attackers from adding the spoofed ARP entries for machines in the network
	- Turn off network identification broadcasts and, if possible, restrict the network to authorized users to protect the network from being discovered with sniffing tools
	- Use IPv6 instead of IPv4
	- Use encrypted sessions such as SSH instead of telnet, Secure Copy (SCP) instead of FTP, and SSL for email connection to protect wireless network users against sniffing attacks
	- Use HTTPS instead of HTTP to protect usernames and passwords
	- Use a switch instead of the hub, as a switch delivers data only to the intended recipient
	- Use Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) instead of FTP for secure transfer of files
	- Use PGP and S/MIME, VPN, IPSec, SSL/TLS, SSH, and one-time passwords (OTP)
	- Use POP2 or POP3 instead of POP to download emails from email servers
	- Use SNMPv3 instead of SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 to manage networked devices
	- Always encrypt the wireless traffic with a strong encryption protocol such as WPA or WPA2
	- Retrieve MAC addresses directly from NICs instead of the OS; this prevents MAC address spoofing
	- Use tools to determine if any NICs are running in promiscuous mode
	- Use the concept of Access Control List (ACL) to allow access only to a fixed range of trusted IP addresses in a network
	- Change default passwords to complex passwords
	- Avoid broadcasting SSIDs (Session Set Identifiers)
	- Implement a MAC filtering mechanism on your router
	- Implement network scanning and monitoring tools to detect malicious intrusions, rogue devices, and sniffers connected to the network

	- Sniffer Detection Techniques: Ping Method
		- Sends a ping request to the suspect machine with its IP address and an incorrect MAC address. The Ethernet adapter rejects it, as the MAC address does not match, whereas the suspect machine running the sniffer responds to it as it does not reject packets with a different MAC address

	- Sniffer Detection Techniques: DNS Method
		- Most of the sniffers perform reverse DNS lookups to identify the machine from the IP address
		- A machine generating reverse DNS lookup traffic is very likely to be running a sniffer

	- Sniffer Detection Techniques: ARP Method
		- Only the machine in the promiscuous mode (machine C) caches the ARP information (IP and MAC address mapping)
		- A machine in the promiscuous mode responds to the ping message as it has the correct information about the host sending the ping requests in its cache; the rest of the machines will send an ARP probe to identify the source of the ping request

- Denial-of-Service
	- DoS and DDoS Attacks 
		- What is a DoS Attack?
			- Denial-of-Service (DoS) is an attack on a computer or network that reduces, restricts, or prevents accessibility of system resources to its legitimate users
			- Attackers flood the victim system with non-legitimate service requests or traffic to overload its resources
		- What is a DDoS Attack? https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com
			- Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) is a coordinated attack that involves a multitude of compromised systems (Botnet) attacking a single target, thereby denying service to users of the targeted system

	- DoS/DDoS Attack Techniques: UDP Flood Attack
		- An attacker sends spoofed UDP packets at a very high packet rate to a remote host on random ports of a target server using a large source IP range
		- The flooding of UDP packets causes the server to repeatedly check for non-existent applications at the ports
		- Legitimate applications are inaccessible by the system and give an error reply with an ICMP “Destination Unreachable” packet
		- This attack consumes network resources and available bandwidth, exhausting the network until it goes offline

	- DoS/DDoS Attack Techniques: ICMP Flood Attack
		- ICMP flood attacks are a type of attack in which attackers send large volumes of ICMP echo request packets to a victim system directly or through reflection networks
		- These packets signal the victim’s system to reply, and the resulting combination of traffic saturates the bandwidth of the victim’s network connection, causing it to be overwhelmed and subsequently stop responding to legitimate TCP/IP requests

	- DoS/DDoS Attack Techniques: Ping of Death Attack
		- In a Ping of Death (PoD) attack, an attacker tries to crash, destabilize, or freeze the targeted system or service by sending malformed or oversized packets using a simple ping command
		- For instance, the attacker sends a packet which has a size of 65,538 bytes to the target web server. This packet size exceeds the size limit prescribed by RFC 791 IP, which is 65,535 bytes. 

	- DoS/DDoS Attack Techniques: Smurf Attack
		- The attacker spoofs the source IP address with the victim’s IP address and sends a large number of ICMP ECHO request packets to an IP broadcast network
		- This causes all the hosts on the broadcast network to respond to the received ICMP ECHO requests. These responses will be sent to the victim machine, ultimately causing the machine to crash

	- DoS/DDoS Attack Techniques: SYN Flood Attack
		- The attacker sends a large number of SYN requests with fake source IP addresses to the target server (victim)
		- The target machine sends back a SYN/ACK in response to the request and waits for the ACK to complete the session setup
		- The target machine does not get the response because the source address is fake
		- SYN flooding takes advantage of a flaw in the implementation of the TCP three-way handshake in most hosts

	- DoS/DDoS Attack Techniques: Fragmentation Attack
		- These attacks stop a victim from being able to re-assemble fragmented packets by flooding the target system with TCP or UDP fragments, resulting in reduced performance
		- Attackers send a large number of fragmented (1500+ byte) packets to a target web server with a relatively small packet rate
		- Reassembling and inspecting these large fragmented packets consumes excessive resources

	- DoS/DDoS Attack Techniques: Multi-Vector Attack
		- The attackers use combinations of volumetric, protocol, and application-layer attacks to disable the target system or service
		- Attackers rapidly and repeatedly change the form of their DDoS attack (e.g., SYN packets, Layer 7)		

	- DoS/DDoS Attack Techniques: Peer-to-Peer Attack
		- Attackers instruct clients of peer-to-peer file sharing hubs to disconnect from their peer-to-peer network and to connect to the victim's fake website
		- Attackers exploit flaws found in the network using the DC++ (Direct Connect) protocol, which is used for sharing all types of files between instant messaging clients
		- Using this method, attackers launch massive denial-of-service attacks and compromise websites

	- DoS/DDoS Attack Techniques: Permanent Denialof-Service Attack
		- Permanent DoS, also known as phlashing, refers to attacks that cause irreversible damage to system hardware
		- Unlike other DoS attacks, it sabotages the system hardware, requiring the victim to replace or reinstall the hardware
		- This attack is carried out using a method known as “bricking a system”
		- Using this method, attackers send fraudulent hardware updates to the victims

	- DoS/DDoS Attack Techniques: Distributed Reflection Denial-of-Service (DRDoS) Attack
		- DRDoS, also known as a spoofed attack, involves the use of multiple intermediary and secondary machines that contribute to the actual DDoS attack against the target machine or application
		- Attackers launch this attack by sending requests to the intermediary hosts, which then redirect the requests to the secondary machines, which in turn reflect the attack traffic to the target

	- DoS/DDoS Attack Tools
		- hping3
			- A command-line-oriented network scanning and packet crafting tool for the TCP/IP protocol that sends ICMP echo requests and supports TCP, UDP, ICMP, and raw-IP protocols

		- F5 (https://f5.com)

- Session Hijacking 
	- Session Hijacking Attacks 
		- Session hijacking refers to an attack in which an attacker seizes control of a valid TCP communication session between two computers
		- As most authentications only occur at the start of a TCP session, this allows the attacker to gain access to a machine
		- Attackers can sniff all the traffic from the established TCP sessions and perform identity theft, information theft, fraud, etc.
		- The attacker steals a valid session ID and uses it to authenticate himself with the server

	- Why is Session Hijacking Successful?
		- Absence of account lockout for invalid session IDs
		- Weak session-ID generation algorithm or small session IDs
		- Insecure handling of session IDs
		- Indefinite session timeout
		- Most computers using TCP/IP are vulnerable
		- Most countermeasures do not work without encryption

	- Session Hijacking Process
		- Tracking the connection
		- Desynchronizing the connection
		- Injecting the attacker's packet

	- Types of Session Hijacking
		- Passive Session Hijacking
			- In a passive attack, an attacker hijacks a session but sits back, watches, and records all the traffic in that session
		- Active Session Hijacking
			- In an active attack, an attacker finds an active session and seizes control of it

	- Session Hijacking in OSI Model
		- Network Level Hijacking
			- Defined as the interception of packets during the transmission between a client and the server in a TCP or UDP session
		- Application Level Hijacking
			- Refers to gaining control over the HTTP’s user session by obtaining the session IDs

	- Spoofing vs. Hijacking
		- Spoofing Attack
			- An attacker pretends to be another user or machine (victim) to gain access
			- The attacker does not seize control of an existing active session; instead, he or she initiates a new session using the victim’s stolen credentials
		- Hijacking
			- Session hijacking is the process of seizing control of an existing active session
			- The attacker relies on the legitimate user to create a connection and authenticate

		- Use HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) to allow users to authenticate web servers.
		- Enable browsers to verify website authenticity using network notary servers.
		- Implement DNS-based authentication of named entities.
		- Disable compression mechanisms of HTTP requests.
		- Use cipher-chaining block (CBC) ciphers incorporating random padding up to 255 bytes, thereby making the extraction of confidential information difficult for an attacker.

		- Attacker uses compromised PCs with spoofed IP addresses to amplify the DDoS attacks on victims’ DNS server by exploiting the DNS recursive method

	- Web Server Attacks: Directory Traversal Attacks
		- In directory traversal attacks, attackers use the ../ (dot-dot-slash) sequence to access restricted directories outside the web server root directory
		- Attackers can use the trial and error method to navigate outside the root directory and access sensitive information in the system

	- Web Server Attacks: Website Defacement
		- Web defacement occurs when an intruder maliciously alters the visual appearance of a web page by inserting or substituting provocative, and frequently, offending data
		- Defaced pages expose visitors to some propaganda or misleading information until the unauthorized changes are discovered and corrected

	- Web Server Attacks: Web Server Misconfiguration
		- Server misconfiguration refers to configuration weaknesses in web infrastructure that can be exploited to launch various attacks on web servers such as directory traversal, server intrusion, and data theft

	- Web Server Attacks: Web Cache Poisoning Attack
		- Web cache poisoning attacks the reliability of an intermediate web cache source
		- In this attack, the attackers swap cached content for a random URL with infected content
		- Users of the web cache source can unknowingly use the poisoned content instead of the true and secured content when requesting the required URL through the web cache
	
	- Web Server Attacks: SSH Brute Force Attack
		- SSH protocols are used to create an encrypted SSH tunnel between two hosts to transfer unencrypted data 01 over an insecure network

- Web Application Attacks 
- Web Application Architecture and Vulnerability Stack 
	- Introduction to Web Applications
		- Web applications provide an interface between end users and web servers through a set of web pages that are generated at the server end or contain script code to be executed dynamically within the client web browser
		- Though web applications enforce certain security policies, they are vulnerable to various attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and session hijacking

		- The advantages of web applications are listed below:
			- As they are independent of the operating system, their development and troubleshooting are easy and cost-effective.
			- They are accessible anytime and anywhere using a computer with an Internet connection.
			- The user interface is customizable, making it easy to update.
			- Users can access them on any device having an Internet browser, including PDAs, smartphones, etc.
			- Dedicated servers, monitored and managed by experienced server administrators, store all the web application data, allowing developers to increase their workload capacity.
			- Multiple locations of servers not only increase physical security but also reduce the burden of monitoring thousands of desktops using the program.
			- They use flexible core technologies, such as JSP, Servlets, Active Server Pages, SQL Server, .NET, and scripting languages, which are scalable and support even portable platforms.

	- How Web Applications Work
	- Web Application Architecture
	- Web Services

		- There are three roles in a web service:
			- Service Provider
			- Service Requester
			- Service Registry
		- There are three operations in a web service architecture:
			- Publish

	- Injection Flaws
		- Injection flaws are web application vulnerabilities that allow untrusted data to be interpreted and executed as part of a command or query
		- Attackers exploit injection flaws by constructing malicious commands or queries that result in data loss or corruption, lack of accountability, or denial of access

		- SQL Injection
			- It involves the injection of malicious SQL queries into user input forms
		- Command Injection
			- It involves the injection of malicious code through a web application
		- LDAP Injection
			- It involves the injection of malicious LDAP statements

	- Broken Authentication
		- Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in authentication or session management functions such as exposed accounts, session IDs, logout, password management, timeouts, etc. to impersonate users

		- Session ID in URLs
			- Attackers sniff the network traffic or trick users to get session IDs and then reuse those session IDs for malicious purposes
		- Password Exploitation
			- Attackers can gain access to a web application's password database. If user passwords are not encrypted, an attacker can exploit any user’s password
		- Timeout Exploitation
			- If an application’s timeouts are not set properly and a user closes their browser without logging out from sites accessed through a public computer, an attacker can use the same browser later and exploit that user's privileges

	- Sensitive Data Exposure
		- Sensitive data exposure occurs due to flaws like insecure cryptographic storage and information leakage
		- When an application uses poorly written encryption code to securely encrypt and store sensitive data in the database, an attacker can exploit this flaw and steal or modify weakly protected sensitive data such as credit cards numbers, SSNs, and other authentication credentials

	- XML External Entity (XXE)
		- XML External Entity attack is a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack that can occur when a misconfigured XML parser allows applications to parse XML input from an unreliable source
		- Attackers can a refer a victim’s web application to an external entity by including the reference in the malicious XML input
		- When this malicious input is processed by the weakly configured XML parser of a target web application, it enables the attacker to access protected files and services from servers or connected networks

	- Broken Access Control
		- Broken access control is a method in which an attacker identifies a flaw related to access control and bypasses the authentication, which allows them to compromise the network
		- It allows an attacker to act as users or administrators with privileged functions and create, access, update or delete every record

		- Insecure Direct Object References
		- Missing Function Level Access Control

	- Security Misconfiguration
		- Unvalidated Inputs
			- It refers to a web application vulnerability where input from a client is not validated before being processed by web applications and backend servers
		- Parameter/Form Tampering
			- It involves the manipulation of parameters exchanged between client and server to modify application data
		- Improper Error Handling
			- It gives insight into source code such as logic flaws, and default accounts. Using the information received from an error message, an attacker identifies vulnerabilities to launch various web application attacks
		- Insufficient Transport Layer Protection
			- It supports weak algorithms and uses expired or invalid certificates. Using insufficient transport layer protection exposes user data to untrusted third parties and can lead to account theft

	- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks
		- Cross-site scripting ('XSS' or 'CSS') attacks exploit vulnerabilities in dynamically generated web pages, enabling malicious attackers to inject clientside scripts into web pages viewed by other users
		- It occurs when unvalidated input data is included in dynamic content that is sent to a user's web browser for rendering
		- Some exploitations that can be performed by XSS attacks are as follows:
			- Malicious script execution
			- Redirecting to a malicious server
			- Exploiting user privileges
			- Ads in hidden IFRAMES and pop-ups
			- Data manipulation
			- Session hijacking
			- Brute-force password cracking
			- Data theft
			- Intranet probing
			- Keylogging and remote monitoring

	- Insecure Deserialization
		- Data serialization and deserialization is an effective process of linearizing and delinearizing data objects for transmission to other networks or systems
		- Attackers inject malicious code into serialized data and forward the malicious serialized data to the victim
		- Insecure deserialization deserializes the malicious serialized content along with the injected malicious code, compromising the system or network

	- Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
		- Most web applications that use components such as libraries and frameworks always execute them with full privileges, and flaws in any component can result in serious impact
		- Attackers can identify weak components or dependencies by scanning or by performing manual analysis
		- Attackers search for any vulnerabilities on exploit sites such as Exploit Database (https://www.exploit-db.com), and SecurityFocus (https://www.securityfocus.com)
		- If a vulnerable component is identified, the attacker customizes the exploit as required and execute the attack

	- Insufficient Logging and Monitoring
		- Web applications maintain logs to track usage patterns, such as user login credentials and admin login credentials
		- Insufficient logging and monitoring refer to the scenario where the detection software either does not record the malicious event or ignores important details about the event
		- Attackers usually inject, delete, or tamper the web application logs to engage in malicious activities or hide their identities

		- Configure the SSL provider to support only strong algorithms
		- Ensure that the certificate is valid and not expired, and that it matches all domains used by the site
		- Backend and other connections should also use SSL or other encryption technologies

	- XSS Attacks
		- Validate all headers, cookies, query strings, form fields, and hidden fields (i.e., all parameters) against a rigorous specification
		- Use testing tools extensively during the design phase to eliminate such XSS holes in the application before it goes into use
		- Use a web application firewall to block the execution of a malicious script
		- Convert all non-alphanumeric characters into HTML character entities before displaying the user input in search engines and forums
		- Encode the input and output and filter metacharacters in the input
		- Never trust websites that use HTTPS when it comes to XSS
		- Filtering the script output can also defeat XSS vulnerabilities by preventing them from being transmitted to users
		- Deploy public key infrastructure (PKI) for authentication, which checks to ascertain that the script introduced is actually authenticated
		- Implement a stringent security policy
		- Web servers, application servers, and web application environments are vulnerable to cross-site scripting. It is difficult to identify and remove XSS flaws from web applications. The best way to find flaws is to perform a security review of the code and search in all the places where the input from an HTTP request comes as an output through HTML.
		- Attacker uses a variety of HTML tags to transmit a malicious JavaScript. Nessus, Nikto, and other tools can help to some extent in scanning websites for these flaws. If the scanning discovers a vulnerability in a website, it is highly likely to be vulnerable to other attacks.

	- Insecure Deserialization
		- Validate untrusted input that is to be serialized to ensure that the serialized data contains only trusted classes

- SQL Injection Attacks 
	- SQL injection is a technique used to take advantage of un-sanitized input vulnerabilities to pass SQL commands through a web application for execution by a backend database
	- It is a basic attack used to either gain unauthorized access to a database or retrieve information directly from the database

	- Why Bother about SQL Injection?
		- Based on the use of applications and the way they process user supplied data, SQL injections can be used to implement the following types of attacks:
			- Authentication Bypass: Using this attack, an attacker logs onto an application without providing a valid username and password, and gains administrative privileges.
			- Authorization Bypass: Using this attack, an attacker alters authorization information stored in the database by exploiting an SQL injection vulnerability.
			- Information Disclosure: Using this attack, an attacker obtains sensitive information that is stored in the database.
			- Compromised Data Integrity: Using this attack, an attacker defaces a web page, inserts malicious content into web pages, or alters the contents of a database.
			- Compromised Availability of Data: Using this attack, an attacker deletes the database information, delete logs, or audit information stored in a database.
			- Remote Code Execution: Using this attack, an attacker compromises the host OS.

	- SQL Injection and Server-side Technologies
		- Server-side Technology
			- Powerful server-side technologies like ASP.NET and database servers allow developers to create dynamic, data-driven websites, and web apps with incredible ease
		- Exploit
			- The power of ASP.NET and SQL can easily be exploited by hackers using SQL injection attacks
		- Susceptible Databases
			- All relational databases, SQL Server, Oracle, IBM DB2, and MySQL, are susceptible to SQL-injection attacks
		- Attack
			- SQL injection attacks do not exploit a specific software vulnerability, instead they target websites and web apps that do not follow secure coding practices for accessing and manipulating data stored in a relational database

	- Types of SQL Injection
		- There are three main types of SQL injection:
			- In-band SQL Injection
			- Blind/Inferential SQL Injection
			- Out-of-Band SQL Injection

	- In-Band SQL Injection
		- Attackers use the same communication channel to perform the attack and retrieve the results
		- Types of in-band SQL Injection
			- Error-based SQL Injection: Attackers intentionally insert bad input into an application, thereby causing it to throw database errors
			- Illegal/Logically Incorrect Query: Attackers send an incorrect query to the database intentionally to generate an error message that may be helpful in performing further attacks		
			- Union SQL Injection: Attackers use a UNION clause to add a malicious query to the requested query
			- System Stored Procedure: Attackers exploit databases' stored procedures to perpetrate their attacks
			- Tautology: Attackers inject statements that are always true so that the queries always return results after evaluating the WHERE condition SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ‘’ OR ‘1’=‘1’;
			- End of Line Comment: After injecting the code into a specific field, legitimate code that follows is nullified using end of line comments SELECT * FROM user WHERE name = 'x' AND userid IS NULL; --';
			- In-line Comments: Attackers integrate multiple vulnerable inputs into a single query using inline comments INSERT INTO Users (UserName, isAdmin, Password) VALUES(‘Attacker', 1, /*’, 0, ‘*/’mypwd’)
			- Piggybacked Query: Attackers inject additional malicious query into the original query. Consequently, the DBMS executes multiple SQL queries SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE EMP.EID = 1001 AND EMP.ENAME = ’Bob’; DROP TABLE DEPT;

	- Error Based SQL Injection
		- Error based SQL Injection forces the database to perform some operation in which the result will be an error
		- This exploitation may differ depending on the DBMS

	- Union SQL Injection
		- This technique involves joining a forged query to the original query
		- The result of a forged query will be joined to the result of the original query, thereby allowing it to obtain the values of fields of other tables

	- Blind/Inferential SQL Injection
		- No Error Message 
			- Blind SQL Injection is used when a web application is vulnerable to an SQL injection, but the results of the injection are not visible to the attacker
		- Generic Page 
			- Blind SQL injection is identical to a normal SQL Injection, except that a generic custom page is displayed when an attacker attempts to exploit an application rather than seeing a useful error message
		- Time-intensive 
			- This type of attack can become time intensive because a new statement must be crafted for each bit recovered

	- Blind SQL Injection: No Error Message Returned

	- Blind SQL Injection: WAITFOR DELAY (YES or NO Response)

	- Blind SQL Injection: Boolean Exploitation
		- Multiple valid statements that evaluate true and false are supplied in the affected parameter in the HTTP request
		- By comparing the response page between both conditions, the attackers can infer whether or not the injection was successful

	- Blind SQL Injection: Heavy Query
		- Attackers use heavy queries to perform a time delay SQL injection attack without using time delay functions
		- A heavy query retrieves a significant amount of data and takes a long time to execute in the database engine
		- Attackers generate heavy queries using multiple joins on system tables

	- Out-of-Band SQL injection
		- In Out-of-Band SQL injection, the attacker needs to communicate with the server and acquire features of the database server used by the web application
		- Attackers use different communication channels to perform the attack and obtain the results
		- Attackers use DNS and HTTP requests to retrieve data from the database server
		- For example, in a Microsoft SQL Server, an attacker exploits the xp_dirtree command to send DNS requests to a server controlled by the attacker

- SQL Injection Attack Countermeasures 
	- Make no assumptions about the size, type, or content of the data that is received by your application
	- Test the size and data type of the input and enforce appropriate limits to prevent buffer overruns
	- Test the content of string variables and accept only expected values
	- Reject entries that contain binary data, escape sequences, and comment characters
	- Never build Transact-SQL statements directly from user input and use stored procedures to validate user input
	- Implement multiple layers of validation and never concatenate user input that is not validated
	- Avoid constructing dynamic SQL with concatenated input values
	- Ensure that the web config files for each application do not contain sensitive information
	- Use the most restrictive SQL account types for applications
	- Use network, host, and application intrusion detection systems to monitor injection attacks
	- Perform automated black box injection testing, static source code analysis, and manual penetration testing to probe for vulnerabilities
	- Keep untrusted data separate from commands and queries
	- In the absence of parameterized API, use specific escape syntax for the interpreter to eliminate special characters
	- Use a secure hash algorithm such as SHA256 to store user passwords rather than plaintext
	- Use the data access abstraction layer to enforce secure data access across an entire application
	- Ensure that the code tracing and debug messages are removed prior to deploying an application
	- Design the code such that it traps and handles exceptions appropriately
	- Apply least privilege rules to run the applications that access the DBMS
	- Validate user-supplied data as well as data obtained from untrusted sources on the server side
	- Avoid quoted/delimited identifiers as they significantly complicate all whitelisting, blacklisting, and escaping efforts
	- Use a prepared statement to create a parameterized query to block the execution of the query
	- Ensure that all user inputs are sanitized before using them in dynamic SQL statements
	- Use regular expressions and stored procedures to detect potentially harmful code

			- The bandwidth suffers as the number of devices in the network increases
			- Wi-Fi upgrades may require new wireless cards and/or APs
			- Some electronic equipment can interfere with Wi-Fi networks
	- Types of Wireless Networks
		- Extension to a Wired Network
		- Multiple Access Points
		- LAN-to-LAN Wireless Network
		- 3G/4G Hotspot

	- Wireless Standards
		- 802.11: The 802.11 (Wi-Fi) standard applies to WLANs and uses FHSS or DSSS as the frequency-hopping spectrum. It allows an electronic device to establish a wireless connection in any network.
		- 802.11a: It is the first amendment to the original 802.11 standard. The 802.11 standard operates in the 5 GHz frequency band and supports bandwidths up to 54 Mbps using orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM). It has a high maximum speed but is relatively more sensitive to walls and other obstacles.
		- 802.11b: IEEE extended the 802.11 standard by creating the 802.11b specifications in 1999. This standard operates in the 2.4 GHz ISM band and supports bandwidths up to 11 Mbps using direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) modulation.
		- 802.11d: The 802.11d standard is an enhanced version of 802.11a and 802.11b that supports regulatory domains. The specifications of this standard can be set in the media access control (MAC) layer.
		- IEEE 802.11e: It is used for real-time applications such as voice, VoIP, and video. To ensure that these time-sensitive applications have the network resources they need, 802.11e defines mechanisms to ensure quality of service (QoS) to Layer 2 of the reference model, which is the MAC layer.
		- 802.11g: It is an extension of 802.11 and supports a maximum bandwidth of 54 Mbps using OFDM technology. It uses the same 2.4 GHz band as 802.11b. The IEEE 802.11g standard defines high-speed extensions to 802.11b and is compatible with the 802.11b standard, which means 802.11b devices can work directly with an 802.11g AP.
		- 802.11i: The IEEE 802.11i standard improves WLAN security by implementing new encryption protocols such as the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).
		- 802.11n: The IEEE 802.11n is a revision that enhances the 802.11g standard with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antennas. It works in both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. Furthermore, it is an IEEE industry standard for Wi-Fi wireless local network transportation. Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) and WLAN use OFDM.
		- 802.11ah: Also called Wi-Fi HaLow, uses 900 MHz bands for extended-range Wi-Fi networks and supports Internet of Things (IoT) communication with higher data rates and wider coverage range than the previous standards.
		- 802.11ac: It provides a high-throughput network at a frequency of 5 GHz. It is faster and more reliable than the 802.11n standard. Moreover, it involves Gigabit networking, which provides an instantaneous data-transfer experience.
		- 802.11ad: The 802.11ad standard includes a new physical layer for 802.11 networks and works on the 60 GHz spectrum. The data propagation speed in this standard is much higher from those of standards operating on the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, such as 802.11n.
		- 802.12: Media utilization is dominated by this standard because it works on the demand priority protocol. The Ethernet speed with this standard is 100 Mbps. Furthermore, it is compatible with the 802.3 and 802.5 standards. Users currently on those standards can directly upgrade to the 802.12 standard.
		- 802.15: It defines the standards for a wireless personal area network (WPAN) and describes the specifications for wireless connectivity with fixed or portable devices.
		- 802.15.1 (Bluetooth): Bluetooth is mainly used for exchanging data over short distances on fixed or mobile devices. This standard works on the 2.4 GHz band.
		- 802.15.4 (ZigBee): The 802.15.4 standard has a low data rate and complexity. The specification used in this standard is ZigBee, transmits long-distance data through a mesh network. The specification handles applications with a low data rate of 250 Kbps, but its use increases battery life.
		- 802.15.5: This standard deploys itself on a full-mesh or half-mesh topology. It includes network initialization, addressing, and unicasting.
		- 802.16: The IEEE 802.16 standard is a wireless communications standard designed to provide multiple physical layer (PHY) and MAC options. It is also known as WiMax. This standard is a specification for fixed broadband wireless metropolitan access networks (MANs) that use a point-to-multipoint architecture.

- Wireless Encryption 
	- Types of Wireless Encryption
		- 802.11i: An IEEE amendment that specifies security mechanisms for 802.11 wireless networks
		- WEP: An encryption algorithm for IEEE 802.11 wireless networks
		- EAP: Supports multiple authentication methods, such as token cards, Kerberos, and certificates
		- LEAP: A proprietary version of EAP developed by Cisco
		- WPA: An advanced wireless encryption protocol using TKIP and MIC to provide stronger encryption and authentication
		- TKIP: A security protocol used in WPA as a replacement for WEP
		- WPA2 Enterprise: Integrates EAP standards with WPA2 encryption
		- CCMP: An encryption protocol used in WPA2 for stronger encryption and authentication
		- AES: A symmetric-key encryption, used in WPA2 as a replacement for TKIP
		- WPA2: An upgrade to WPA using AES and CCMP for wireless data encryption
		- RADIUS: A centralized authentication and authorization management system
		- PEAP: A protocol that encapsulates the EAP within an encrypted and authenticated transport layer security (TLS) tunnel
		- WPA3: A third-generation Wi-Fi security protocol that uses GCMP-256 for encryption and HMAC-SHA-384 for authentication
	
	- Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) Encryption
		- WEP is a security protocol defined by the 802.11b standard; it was designed to provide a wireless LAN with a level of security and privacy comparable to that of a wired LAN
		- WEP uses a 24-bit initialization vector to form stream cipher RC4 for confidentiality and the CRC-32 checksum for integrity of wireless transmissions
		- It has significant vulnerabilities and design flaws and can therefore be easily cracked
	
	- Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) Encryption
		- WPA is a security protocol defined by 802.11i standards; it uses a Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) that utilizes the RC4 stream cipher encryption with 128-bit keys and 64-bit MIC integrity check to provide stronger encryption and authentication
		- WPA uses TKIP to eliminate the weaknesses of WEP by including per-packet mixing functions, message integrity checks, extended initialization vectors, and re-keying mechanisms
	
	- WPA2 Encryption
		- WPA2 is an upgrade to WPA, and it includes mandatory support for counter mode with cipher block chaining message authentication code protocol (CCMP), an AES-based encryption mode with strong security
		- Modes of Operation
			- WPA2-Personal: It uses a set-up password (pre-shared Key, PSK) to protect unauthorized network accesses
			- WPA2-Enterprise: It includes EAP or RADIUS for centralized client authentication using multiple authentication methods, such as token cards, and Kerberos

	- WPA3 Encryption
		- WPA3 is an advanced implementation of WPA2 providing trailblazing protocols and uses the AESGCMP 256 encryption algorithm
		- Modes of Operation
			- WPA3-Personal
				- It is mainly used to deliver passwordbased authentication using the SAE protocol, also known as Dragonfly Key Exchange
				- It is resistant to offline dictionary attacks and key recovery attacks
			- WPA3-Enterprise
				- It protects sensitive data using many cryptographic algorithms
				- It provides authenticated encryption using GCMP-256
				- It uses HMAC-SHA-384 to generate cryptographic keys
				- It uses ECDSA-384 for exchanging keys

	- Comparison of WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3

- Wireless Network-Specific Attack Techniques 
	- Rogue AP Attack
		- A rogue wireless AP placed into an 802.11 network can be used to hijack the connections of legitimate network users
		- When the user turns on the computer, the rogue wireless AP will offer to connect with the network user’s NIC
		- All the traffic the user enters will pass through the rogue AP, thus enabling a form of wireless packet sniffing

	- Client Mis-Association
		- Attacker sets up a rogue AP outside the corporate perimeter and lures the employees of the organization to connect with it
		- Once associated, attackers may bypass the enterprise security policies

	- Misconfigured AP Attack
		- SSID Broadcast: APs are configured to broadcast SSIDs to authorized users
		- Weak Password: To verify authorized users, network administrators incorrectly use the SSIDs as passwords
		- Configuration Error: SSID broadcasting is a configuration error that enables intruders to steal an SSID and cause the AP assume they are allowed to connect

	- Unauthorized Association
		- Soft APs are client cards or embedded WLAN radios in some PDAs and laptops that can be launched inadvertently or through a virus program
		- Attackers infect a victim's machine and activate soft APs, thus allowing them unauthorized connection to the enterprise network
		- Attackers connect to enterprise networks through soft APs instead of the actual APs
		
	- Ad-Hoc Connection Attack
		- Wi-Fi clients communicate directly via an ad hoc mode that does not require an AP to relay packets 
		- An ad hoc mode is inherently insecure and does not provide strong authentication and encryption 
		- Thus, attackers can easily connect to and compromise the enterprise client operating in ad hoc mode

	- Honeypot AP Attack

	- AP MAC Spoofing
		- Hacker spoofs the MAC address of WLAN client equipment to mask as an authorized client
		- Attacker connects to AP as an authorized client and eavesdrops on sensitive information

	- Key Reinstallation Attack (KRACK)
		- All secure Wi-Fi networks use the 4-way handshake process to join the network and generate a fresh encryption key that will be used to encrypt the network traffic
		- The KRACK attack works by exploiting the 4-way handshake of the WPA2 protocol by forcing Nonce reuse
		- KRACK works against all modern protected Wi-Fi networks and allows attackers to steal sensitive information, such as credit card numbers, passwords, chat messages, emails, and photos

	- Jamming Signal Attack
		- All wireless networks are prone to jamming
		- This jamming signal causes a DoS because 802.11 is a CSMA/CA protocol whose collision avoidance algorithms require a period of silence before a radio is allowed to transmit
		- An attacker stakes out the area from a nearby location with a high-gain amplifier drowning out the legitimate AP
	- Wi-Fi Jamming Devices
		- Examples for Wi-Fi jamming devices: http://www.techwisetech.com
			- CPB-3016N-E5G Jammer
			- PCB-2040 Jammer
			- CPB-2060B Jammer

- Mobile Attack Countermeasures 
	- OWASP Top 10 Mobile Controls https://www.owasp.org

	- Identify and protect sensitive data on the mobile device
		- In the design phase, classify the data storage according to the sensitivity and then apply the controls. Process, store, and use data based on its classification
		- Apply validation of the security of API calls to the sensitive data
		- Store the sensitive data on the server instead of the client-side device, as it supports secure network connectivity and other protection mechanisms
		- Use file encryption API provided by the OS or other trusted source when storing data in a device.
		- Use encryption to store sensitive data and store it in a tamper-proof area if possible
		- Restrict access to sensitive data based on contextual information, e.g., location
		- Always make sure to turn off the location, GPS tracking, or other sensitive information when not in use
		- Always be aware of the public shared storage as it is easily vulnerable to data leakage
		- Apply the principle of minimal disclosure and identify the type of data needed in the design phase
		- Use non-persistent identifiers wherever possible, which are not shared with other apps
		- Applications should use remote wipe and kill switch APIs for removing sensitive information from the device in the event of theft or loss

		- Ensure that session management is handled properly after the initial authentication using appropriate secure protocols
		- Use unpredictable session identifiers with high entropy and repeated application of SHA1 for combining random variables
		- Use contexts such as IP location for adding security to authentication
		- Ensure the use of additional authentication factors for mobile applications that give access to sensitive data using voice, fingerprint, or other behavioral inputs
		- Use authentication that depends on the end-user identity rather than the device identity

	- Keep the backend APIs (services) and the platform (server) secure
		- Perform detailed code checking for sensitive data that is transferred unintentionally between the mobile device, web-server backend, and other external interfaces
		- All the backend services for the mobile apps should be tested for vulnerabilities periodically using any static code analyzer tools and fuzzing tools
		- Ensure that the backend platform is running with a hardened configuration with the latest security patches applied to the OS and web server

	- Secure data integration with third-party services and applications
		- Always scrutinize the authenticity of any third-party code or libraries used in the mobile application
		- Regularly update the latest security patches and keep track of all the third-party APIs and framework
		- Validate all the data received and sent before processing for non-trusted third-party applications

	- Pay specific attention to the collection and storage of consent for the collection and use of the user’s data
		- Create a privacy policy that covers the usage of personal data and make it available to users when making consent choices such as at install time or at run time or via opt-out mechanisms
		- Check if any application is collecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
		- Review the communication mechanisms to check for any accidental leaks
		- Always preserve the record of consent to the transfer of PII
		- Ensure that the consent collection mechanism does not overlap or conflict and try to resolve any conflicts

	- Implement controls to prevent unauthorized access to paid-for resources (wallet, SMS, phone calls, etc.)
		- Maintain access logs to paid-for resources in a non-repudiable format and make them available for end-user monitoring
		- Regularly check for any abnormal usage patterns in paid-for resource usage and activate re-authentication
		- Ensure use of the white-list model by default for addressing paid-for resources
		- Authenticate all the API calls to paid-for resources

	- Ensure secure distribution/provisioning of mobile applications
		- The applications must be designed and provisioned to allow updates for security patches
		- The app stores should monitor the apps for vulnerable code and should be able to remove apps remotely at short notice in the case of an incident
		- Provide a feedback channel for the users to report security problems with the apps

	- Carefully check any runtime interpretation of code for errors
		- Minimize runtime interpretation and the capabilities offered to runtime interpreters and run interpreters with minimum privileges
		- Outline comprehensive escape syntax as appropriate
		- Use fuzz test interpreters and sandbox interpreters

- IoT Threats and Attacks 

	- Challenges of IoT
		- Lack of Security and Privacy: Most IoT devices today, such as household devices, industrial devices, healthcare devices, automobiles, etc., are connected to the Internet and contain important and confidential data. These devices lack even basic security and privacy policies, and hackers can exploit this to carry out malicious activity.
		- Vulnerable Web Interfaces: Many IoT devices come with embedded web server technology that makes them vulnerable to attacks.
		- Legal, Regulatory, and Rights Issue: Due to the interconnection of IoT devices, certain security issues are raised with no existing laws that address these issues.
		- Default, Weak, and Hardcoded Credentials: One of the most common reasons for cyber-attacks on IoT devices is their authentication systems. These devices usually come with default and weak credentials, which can easily be exploited by a hacker to gain unauthorized access to the devices.
		- Clear Text Protocols and Unnecessary Open Ports: IoT devices lack encryption techniques during the transmission of data, which at times causes them to use certain protocols that transmit data in clear text in addition to having open ports.
		- Coding Errors (Buffer Overflow): Most IoT devices today have embedded web services that are subject to the same vulnerabilities that are commonly exploited on web service platforms. As a result, updating such functionality may give rise to issues like buffer overflows, SQL injection, etc. within technology infrastructure.
		- Storage Issues: IoT devices generally come with smaller data storage capacity, but the data collected and transmitted by the devices is limitless. Therefore, this gives rise to data storage, management, and protection issues.
		- Difficult-to-Update Firmware and OS: Upgrading firmware is an essential step toward countering vulnerabilities in a device, but it may impair a device’s functionality. For this reason, developers or manufacturers may hesitate or even refuse to provide product support or make adjustments during the development phase of their products.
		- Interoperability Standard Issues: One of the biggest obstacles for IoT devices is the interoperability issue, which is key to the viability and long-term growth of the entire IoT ecosystem. The issues that arise due to lack of interoperability in IoT devices are the inability of manufacturers to test application programming interfaces (APIs) using common methods and mechanisms, their inability to secure devices using software from third parties, and their inability to manage and monitor devices using a common layer.
		- Physical Theft and Tampering: Physical attacks on IoT devices include tampering with the devices to inject malicious code or files to make the devices work the way the attacker intends, or making hardware modifications to the devices. Counterfeiting the devices may also be an issue when proper physical protection is not present to shield the devices.
		- Lack of Vendor Support for Fixing Vulnerabilities: The firmware of the devices has to be upgraded in order to protect the devices against certain vulnerabilities, but vendors are hesitant, or they usually refuse to get third-party access to their devices.
		- Emerging Economy and Development Issues: With widespread opportunities for IoT devices in every field, multiple layers of complexity are added for policymakers. The new landscape introduced by these devices adds a new dimension for the policymakers, who have to design new blueprints and policies for IoT devices.
		- Handling of Unstructured Data: An increase in the number of connected devices will increase the complexity of handling unstructured data as its volume, velocity, and variety increases. It is important for organizations to understand and determine which data is valuable and actionable.

		- Man-in-the-Middle Attack: An attacker pretends to be a legitimate sender who intercepts all the communication between the sender and receiver and hijacks the communication.
		- Replay Attack: Attackers intercept legitimate messages from valid communication and continuously send the intercepted message to the target device to perform a denial-ofservice attack or crash the target device.
		- Forged Malicious Device: Attackers replace authentic IoT devices with malicious devices if they have physical access to the network.
		- Side-Channel Attack: Attackers perform side-channel attacks by extracting information about encryption keys by observing the emission of signals, i.e., “side channels”, from IoT devices.
		- Ransomware Attack: Ransomware is a type of malware that uses encryption to block a user’s access to his/her device either by locking the screen or by locking the user’s files.
		- Client Impersonation: An attacker masquerades as a legitimate smart device/server using a malicious device and compromises an IoT client device by impersonating it, to perform unauthorized activities or access sensitive information on behalf of the legitimate client.

		- SDR-Based Attack: Using a software-based radio communication system, an attacker can examine the communication signals passing through the IoT network and can send spam messages to the interconnected devices.
		- Fault Injection Attack: A fault injection attack occurs when an attacker tries to introduce fault behavior in an IoT device, with the goal of exploiting these faults to compromise the security of that device.
		- Network Pivoting: An attacker uses a malicious smart device to connect and gain access to a closed server, and then uses that connection to pivot other devices and network connections to the server to steal sensitive information.
		- DNS Rebinding Attack: DNS rebinding is a process of obtaining access to a victim’s router using a malicious JavaScript code injected on a web page.

	- Hacking IoT Devices: General Scenario

	- IoT Attacks: DDoS Attack
		- Attacker initiates the attack by exploiting the vulnerabilities in the devices and installing a malicious software in their operating systems
		- Multiple infected IoT devices are referred to as an Army of Botnets
		- The target is attacked with a large volume of requests from multiple IoT devices present in different locations
	
	- Exploit HVAC
		- Many organizations use Internet-connected heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems without implementing security mechanisms; this gives attackers a gateway to hack corporate systems
		- HVAC systems have many security vulnerabilities that are exploited by attackers to steal login credentials, gain access to the HVAC system, and perform further attack on the organization’s network

		- Steps followed by an attacker to exploit HVAC systems:
			- Attacker uses Shodan (https://www.shodan.io) and searches for vulnerable industrial control systems (ICSs)
			- Based on the vulnerable ICSs found, the attacker then searches for default user credentials using online tools such as https://www.defpass.com
			- Attacker uses default user credentials to attempt to access the ICS
			- After gaining access to the ICS, the attacker attempts to gain access to the HVAC system remotely through the ICS
			- After gaining access to the HVAC system, an attacker can control the temperature from the HVAC or carry out other attacks on the local network

	- Rolling Code Attack
		- For example, given below are the steps followed by an attacker to perform a rolling-code attack:
			- Victim presses car remote button and tries to unlock the car
			- Attacker uses a jammer that jams the car’s reception of the rolling code sent by the victim and simultaneously sniffs the first code
			- The car does not unlock; victim tries again by sending a second code
			- Attacker sniffs the second code
			- On the second attempt by the victim, the attacker forwards the first code, which unlocks the car
			- The recorded second code is used later by the attacker to unlock and steal the vehicle
			- Attackers can make use of tools such as rfcat-rolljam and RFCrack to perform this attack.

	- BlueBorne Attack
		- A BlueBorne attack is performed on Bluetooth connections to gain access and take full control of the target device
		- After gaining access to a device, the attacker can penetrate any corporate network using that device to steal critical information about the organization and spread malware to nearby devices

		- Steps to perform BlueBorne attack:
			- Attacker discovers active Bluetooth-enabled devices around him/her; all Bluetoothenabled devices can be located even if they are not in discoverable mode
			- After locating any nearby device, the attacker obtains the MAC address of the device
			- Now, the attacker sends continuous probes to the target device to determine the OS
			- After identifying the OS, the attacker exploits the vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth protocol to gain access to the target device
			- Now the attacker can perform remote code execution or a man-in-the-middle attack and take full control of the device

	- Jamming Attack
		- Jamming is a type of attack in which the communications between wireless IoT devices are jammed so that they can be compromised
		- An attacker transmits radio signals randomly with the same frequency as the sensor nodes for communication
		- As a result, the network gets jammed, which disables the endpoints from sending or receiving any messages

	- Hacking Smart Grid/Industrial Devices: Remote Access using Backdoor

	- SDR-Based Attacks on IoT
		- The attacker uses software defined radio (SDR) to examine the communication signals in the IoT network and sends spam content or texts to the interconnected devices
			- Replay Attack
				- The attacker obtains the specific frequency used for sharing information between connected devices and captures the original data when a command is initiated by these devices
				- The attacker segregates the command sequence and injects it into the IoT network
			- Cryptanalysis Attack
				- The attacker uses the same procedure as that followed in a replay attack, along with reverse engineering of the protocol to capture the original signal
				- The attacker must be skilled in cryptography, communication theory, and modulation schemes to perform this attack
			- Reconnaissance Attack
				- The attacker obtains information about the target device from the device’s specifications
				- The attacker then uses a multimeter to investigate the chipset and mark some identifications such as ground pins to discover the product ID and other information

	- Fault Injection Attacks
		- Fault injection attacks, also known as Perturbation attacks, occur when a perpetrator injects any faulty or malicious program into the system to compromise the system security

		- Types of Fault Injection Attacks
			- Optical, Electro Magnetic Fault Injection (EMFI), Body Bias Injection (BBI)
				- Attackers inject faults into the device by using projecting lasers and electromagnetic pulses

		- Electronic Security Perimeter: It is referred to as the boundary between secure and insecure zones
		- Critical Infrastructure: A collection of physical or logical systems and assets that the failure or destruction of which will severely impact the security, safety, economy, or public health
	
	- IT/OT Convergence (IIOT)
		- IT/OT convergence is the integration of IT computing systems and OT operation monitoring systems to bridge the gap between IT/OT technologies for improving overall security, efficiency, and productivity
		- The IT/OT convergence can enable smart manufacturing known as industry 4.0, where IoT applications are used in industrial operations
		- Using this Internet of Things (IoT) for industrial operations such as monitoring supply chains, manufacturing and management systems is referred to as Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)

		- Benefits of merging OT with IT
			- Enhancing Decision Making: Decision making can be enhanced by integrating OT data into business intelligence solutions.
			- Enhancing Automation: Business flow and industrial control operations can be optimized by OT/IT merging; together they can improve the automation.
			- Expedite Business Output: IT/OT convergence can organize or streamline development projects to accelerate business output.
			- Minimizing Expenses: Reduces the technological and organizational overheads.
			- Mitigating Risks: Merging these two fields can improve overall productivity, security, and reliability, as well as ensuring scalability.

	- The Purdue Model
		- The Purdue model is derived from the Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture (PERA) model, which is a widely used to describe internal connections and dependencies of important components in the ICS networks
		- The three zones are further divided into several operational levels
			- Enterprise Zone (IT Systems)
				- Level 5 (Enterprise Network)

				- Level 3 (Operational Systems/Site Operations)
				- Level 2 (Control Systems/Area Supervisory Controls)
				- Level 1 (Basic Controls/Intelligent Devices)
				- Level 0 (Physical Process)
			- Industrial Demilitarized Zone (IDMZ)

- OT Threats and Attacks 
	- Challenges of OT
		- Lack of visibility: Broader cybersecurity visibility in the OT network achieves greater security and so one can rapidly respond to any potential threats. However, most organizations do not have clear cybersecurity visibility, making it difficult for the security teams to detect unusual behaviors and signatures.
		- Plain-text passwords: Most industrial site networks use either weak or plain-text passwords. Plain-text passwords lead to weak authentication, which in turn leaves the systems vulnerable to various cyber-reconnaissance attacks.
		- Network complexity: Most OT network environments are complex due to comprising numerous devices, each of which has different security needs and requirements.
		- Legacy technology: OT systems generally use older technologies without appropriate security measures like encryption and password protection, leaving them vulnerable to various attacks. Applying modern security practices is also a challenge.
		- Lack of antivirus protection: Industries using legacy technology and outdated systems are not provided with any antivirus protection, which can update signatures automatically, thus making them vulnerable to malware infections.
		- Lack of skilled security professionals: The cybersecurity skills gap poses a great threat to organizations, as there is a lack of skilled security professionals to discover threats and implement new security controls and defenses in networks.
		- Rapid pace of change: Maintaining the pace of change is the biggest challenge in the field of security, and slow digital transformation can also compromise OT systems.
		- Outdated systems: Most OT devices, such as PLCs, use outdated firmware, making them vulnerable to many modern cyberattacks.
		- Haphazard modernization: As the demand for OT grows, it must stay up to date with the latest technologies. However, due to the use of legacy components in OT system upgrading and patching, updating the system can take several years, which can adversely affect several operations.
		- Insecure connections: OT systems communicate over public Wi-Fi and unencrypted Wi-Fi connections in the IT network for transferring control data, making them susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.
		- Usage of rogue devices: Many industrial sites have unknown or rogue devices connected to their networks, which are vulnerable to various attacks.
		- Convergence with IT: OT mostly connects with the corporate network; as a result, it is vulnerable to various malware attacks and malicious insiders. In addition, the OT systems are IT enabled, and the IT security team does not have much experience with the OT systems and protocols.
		- Organizational challenges: Many organizations implement and maintain different security architectures that meet the needs of both IT and OT. This can create some flaws in security management, leaving ways for the attackers to intrude into the systems easily.
		- Unique production networks/proprietary software: Industries follow unique hardware and software configurations that are dependent on industry standards and explicit operational demands. The use of proprietary software makes it difficult to update and patch firmware, as multiple vendors control it.
		- Vulnerable communication protocols: OT uses communication protocols such as Modbus and Profinet for supervising, controlling, and connecting different mechanisms such as controllers, actuators, and sensors. These protocols lack in-built security features such as authentication, detection of flaws, or detection of abnormal behavior, making them vulnerable to various attacks.
		- Remote management protocols: Industrial sites use remote management protocols such as RDP, VNC, and SSH. Once the attacker compromises and gains access to the OT network, he/she can perform further exploitation to understand and manipulate the configuration and working of the equipment.

		- Power Analysis
			- Attackers observe the change in power consumption of semiconductors during clock cycles
			- By observing the power profile, one character of the password can be retrieved comparing the correct character with the wrong character

	- Containers Vs. Virtual Machines
		- Virtualization is the ability to run multiple operating systems on a single physical system and share the underlying resources such as a server, storage device, or network
		- Containers are placed on the top of one physical server and host operating system, and share the operating system’s kernel binaries and libraries, thereby reducing the need for reproducing the OS

		- Virtual Machines 
			- Heavyweight 
			- Run on independent operating systems 
			- Hardware-based virtualization 
			- Slower provisioning 
			- Limited performance 
			- Completely isolated making it more secure 
			- Created and launched in minutes 

		- Containers
			- Lightweight and portable
			- Share a single host operating system
			- OS-based virtualization
			- Scalable and real-time provisioning
			- Native performance
			- Process-level isolation, partially secured
			- Created and launched in seconds

	- What is Docker?
		- Docker is an open source technology used for developing, packaging, and running applications and all its dependencies in the form of containers, to ensure that the application works in a seamless environment
		- Docker provides a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) through OS-level virtualization and delivers containerized software packages

	- Microservices Vs. Docker
		- Monolithic applications are broken down into cloud-hosted sub-applications called microservices that work together, each performing a unique task
		- As each microservice is packaged into the Docker container along with the required libraries, frameworks, and configuration files, microservices belonging to a single application can be developed and managed using multiple platforms

	- Docker Networking
		- Docker connects multiple containers and services or other non-Docker workloads together
		- The Docker networking architecture is developed on a set of interfaces known as the Container Network Model (CNM)
		- The CNM provides application portability across heterogeneous infrastructures

	- Container Orchestration
		- An automated process of managing the lifecycles of software containers and their dynamic environments
		- It is used for scheduling and distributing the work of individual containers for microservices-based applications spread across multiple clusters

		- Various tasks can be automated using container orchestrator, such as
			- Provisioning and deployment of containers
			- Failover and redundancy of containers
			- Creating or destroying containers to distribute the load evenly across host infrastructure
			- Moving containers from one host to another on resource exhaustion or host failure
			- Automatic resource allocation between containers
			- Exposing running services to the external environment
			- Performing load balancing, traffic routing, and service discovery between containers
			- Performing a health check of running containers and hosts
			- Ensuring the availability of containers
			- Configuring application-related containers
			- Securing the communication between containers

	- What is Kubernetes?
		- Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source, portable, extensible, orchestration platform developed by Google for managing containerized applications and microservices
		- Kubernetes provides a resilient framework for managing distributed containers, generating deployment patterns, and performing failover and redundancy for the applications

		- Features provided by Kubernetes:
			- Service discovery: Kubernetes allows a service to be discovered via a DNS name or IP address.
			- Load balancing: When a container receives heavy traffic, Kubernetes automatically distributes the traffic to other containers and performs load balancing.
			- Storage orchestration: Kubernetes allows developers to mount their own storage capabilities, such as local and public cloud storage.
			- Automated rollouts and rollbacks: Kubernetes automates the process of creating new containers, destroying existing containers, and moving all resources from one container to another.
			- Automatic bin packing: Kubernetes can manage a cluster of nodes that run containerized applications. If you specify the resources needed to run the container, such as processing power and memory, Kubernetes can automatically allocate and deallocate resources to the containers.
			- Self-healing: Kubernetes automatically performs a health check of the containers, replaces the failed containers with new containers, destroys failed containers, and avoids advertising unavailable containers to clients.
			- Secret and configuration management: Kubernetes allows users to store and manage sensitive information such as credentials, secure shell (SSH) keys, and OAuth tokens. Application configuration and sensitive information can be deployed and updated without the need to rebuild the container images.

		- Kubernetes Cluster Architecture

	- Kubernetes Vs. Docker
		- Docker is open source software that can be installed on any host to build, deploy, and run containerized applications on a single operating system
		- When Docker is installed on multiple hosts with different operating systems, you can use Kubernetes to manage these Docker hosts
		- Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform that automates the process of creating, managing, updating, scaling, and destroying containers
		- Kubernetes can be coupled with any containerization technology such as Docker, Rkt, RunC, and cri-o
		- Both Dockers and Kubernetes are based on microservices architecture, and built using the Go programming language to deploy small, lightweight binaries, and YAML files for specifying application configurations and stacks

	- Container Security Challenges
		- Inflow of vulnerable source code: Containers constitute an open-source platform used by developers to regularly update, store, and use images in a repository. This results in an enormous uncontrolled code that may include vulnerabilities, which can compromise security.
		- Large attack surface: The host OS consists of many containers, applications, VMs, and databases in the cloud or on-premises. A large attack surface implies a large number of vulnerabilities and an increased difficulty in detecting them.
		- Lack of visibility: A container engine runs the container, interfaces with the Linux kernel, and creates another layer of abstraction camouflaging the actions of the containers and making it difficult to track activities of specific containers or users.
		- Compromising secrets: Containers require sensitive information, such as API keys, usernames, or passwords, for accessing any services. Attackers who illicitly gain access to this sensitive information can compromise security.
		- DevOps speed: Containers can be executed promptly and, after execution, are stopped and removed. This fugitiveness helps attackers launch attacks and hide themselves without installing any malicious code.
		- Noisy neighboring containers: A container may consume and exhaust all available system resources, which directly affects the operation of other neighboring containers creating a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.
		- Container breakout to the host: Containers that runs as root may break the containment and gain access to the host OS through privilege escalation.
		- Network-based attacks: Attackers may exploit failed containers having active raw sockets and outbound network connections to launch various network-based attacks.
		- Bypassing isolation: Attackers, after compromising the security of a container, may escalate privileges to gain access to other containers or the host itself.
		- Ecosystem complexity: Containers are built, deployed, and managed using multiple vendors and sources. This makes it complex to secure and update the individual components because they originate from different repositories.

- Cloud Computing Threats 
	- OWASP Top 10 Cloud Security Risks https://www.owasp.org

	- Data Ownership
		- Organizations use the public cloud for hosting business services instead of a traditional data center.
		- Sometimes using the cloud causes the loss of data accountability and control, whereas using a traditional data center helps in controlling and protecting the data logically and physically.
		- Using the public cloud can jeopardize data recoverability and result in critical risks, which the organization needs to mitigate promptly.

	- User Identity Federation
		- Enterprises use services and applications of different cloud providers, creating multiple user identities and complicating the management of multiple user IDs and credentials.
		- Cloud providers have less control over the user lifecycle/offboarding.

	- Regulatory Compliance
		- Following regulatory compliance can be complex.
		- Data that is secured in one country may not be secured in another country owing to the lack of transparency and different regulatory laws followed across various countries.

	- Business Continuity and Resiliency
		- Performing business continuity in an IT organization ensures that the business can be conducted in a disaster situation.
		- When organizations use cloud services, there is a chance of risk or monetary loss if the cloud provider handles the business continuity improperly.

	- User Privacy and Secondary Usage of Data
		- The use of social websites poses a risk to personal data because they are stored in the cloud and most social application providers mine user data for secondary usage.
		- The default share feature in social networking sites can jeopardize the privacy of user personal data.

	- Service and Data Integration
		- Organizations must ensure proper protection when proprietary data are transferred from the end-user to the cloud data center.
		- Unsecured data in transit are susceptible to eavesdropping and interception attacks.

	- Multi Tenancy and Physical Security
		- Cloud technology uses the concept of multi-tenancy for sharing resources and services among multiple clients, such as networking, databases.
		- Inadequate logical segregation may lead to tenants interfering with each other’s security features.

	- Incidence Analysis and Forensic Support
		- When a security incident occurs, investigating applications and services hosted at a cloud provider can be challenging because event logs are distributed across multiple hosts and data centers located at several countries and governed by different laws and policies.
		- Owing to the distributed storage of logs across the cloud, law enforcing agencies may face problem in forensics recovery.

	- Infrastructure Security
		- Configuration baselines of the infrastructure should comply with the industry best practices because there is constant risk of malicious actions.
		- Misconfiguration of infrastructure may allow network scanning for vulnerable applications and services to retrieve information, such as active unused ports and default passwords and configurations.

	- Non-Production Environment Exposure
		- Non-production environments are used for application design and development and to test activities internally within an organization.
		- Using non-production environments increases the risk of unauthorized access, information disclosure, and information modification.

		- The attacker compromises the cloud by placing a malicious virtual machine near to a target cloud server and then launches a side-channel attack
		- In a side-channel attack, the attacker runs a virtual machine on the same physical host as the victim’s virtual machine and takes advantage of the shared physical resources (processor cache) to steal data (cryptographic keys) from the victim
		- Side-channel attacks can be implemented by any co-resident user due to the vulnerabilities in shared technology resources

	- Cloud Attacks: Wrapping Attack
		- A wrapping attack is performed during the translation of the SOAP message in the TLS layer where attackers duplicate the body of the message and sends it to the server as a legitimate user

	- Cloud Attacks: Man-in-the-Cloud (MITC) Attack
		- MITC attacks are an advanced version of Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks
		- The attacker tricks the victim into installing a malicious code, which plants the attacker’s synchronization token on the victim’s drive
		- Then, the attacker steals the victim’s synchronization token and uses the stolen token to gain access to the victim’s files

# Module 12: Penetration Testing Fundamentals 

- Fundamentals of Penetration Testing and its Benefits
	- Penetration testing is a type of security testing that evaluates an organization’s ability to protect its infrastructure such as network, applications, systems, and users against external as well as internal threats
	- It is an effective way of determining the efficacy of the organization’s security policies, controls, and technologies
	- It involves the active evaluation of the security of the organization’s infrastructure by simulating an attack similar to those performed by real attackers

	- Benefits of Conducting a Penetration Test
		- Reveal vulnerabilities
		- Show real risks
		- Ensure business continuity
		- Reducing client-end attacks
		- Establishing the status of the company in terms of security 
		- Guard the reputation of the company

	- Comparing Security Audit, Vulnerability Assessment, and Penetration Testing
		- Security Audit: A security audit checks whether an organization follows a set of standard security policies and procedures
		- Vulnerability Assessment: A vulnerability assessment focuses on discovering the vulnerabilities in an information system but provides no indication of whether the vulnerabilities can be exploited or of the amount of damage that may result from the successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities
		- Penetration Testing: Penetration testing is a methodological approach to security assessment that encompasses a security audit and vulnerability assessment, and it demonstrates whether the vulnerabilities in a system can be successfully exploited by attackers

	- Types of Penetration Assessment: Goal-oriented vs. Compliance-oriented vs. Red-team-oriented

		- Goal-oriented/Objective-oriented Penetration Testing
			- This type of assessments is driven by goals. The objectives of the penetration test are defined, rather than defining the scope of targets
			- The goal of penetration assessment is defined before it begins
			- The job of the pen tester to check whether he/she can achieve the goal and to determine the different ways to achieve the goal

			- Examples:
				- Gain remote access to an internal network
				- Gain access to credit-card information
				- Gain domain administrator access
				- Create a denial of service (DoS) condition against a website
				- Deface a website		 

		- Compliance-oriented Penetration Testing
			- This type of assessments is driven by compliance requirements. It is testing against adherence to compliance requirements
			- It entails conducting an assessment against the compliance requirements of cyber security standards, frameworks, laws, acts, etc.
			- For example, an organization may ask to perform a security assessment against PCI-DSS requirements

		- Red-team-based Penetration Testing
			- Red-team-based penetration testing is an adversarial goal-based assessment in which the pen tester must mimic the behavior of a real attacker and target the environment
			- This type of assessment has no specific driver
			- For example, an organization may ask to conduct a security assessment for evaluating its overall security. It may include assessing people, networks, applications, physical security, etc.

- Strategies and Phases of Penetration Testing 
	- Black-box testing
	- White-box testing
	- Gray-box testing

		- Technical risks
			- This type of risks directly arises with targets in the production environment. It includes the following.
				- Failure of the target: Testing continuously consumes a large amount of resources of the target system. This may result in the unavailability of services of the target machine.
				- Disruption of service: The testing process can disrupt some critical services.
				- Loss or exposure of sensitive data: The organization needs to share sensitive data with the pen testers, which may result in the exposure of sensitive data.

		- Organizational risks
			- This type of risks can occur as a side effect of penetration testing. It includes the following.
				- Repetitive and unwanted triggering in the incident-handling processes of the organization
				- Negligence toward monitoring and responding incidents during or after the pen test
				- Disruption in business continuity
				- Loss of reputation

		- Legal risks
			- This type of risks arises from legal obligations due to compliance issues. It includes the violation of laws and clauses in the rules of engagement (ROE).

	- Addressing Risks Associated with Penetration Testing and Avoiding Potential DoS Conditions
		- Use indirect testing: This involves collecting sufficient evidence to prove that a certain vulnerability is likely to exist, instead of directly testing it.
		- Refrain from vulnerability exploitation: Testers should refrain from directly exploiting vulnerabilities. Instead, they should prefer to show the existence of specific vulnerabilities and how they can be exploited.
		- Delay the effect of a test: Testers should attempt to delay the effect of executing a certain test. This will help provide sufficient time to cancel and avoid unwanted risks that may arise from the test.
		- Perform interruptible testing: Testers should be able to pause a certain test if they think that this test may cause unintended consequences.
		- Be careful of using throttled tools: Throttled tools can execute multiple tests simultaneously and can overload the target.
		- Be aware of account lockout functionality: The repetition of a certain test can result in the activation of an account lockout functionality.
		- Use partial isolation and replication of target environment: If possible, testing should be performed on a dedicated test system to avoid any associated risks such as DoS-related situations.
		- Use reserved addresses: If possible, use reserved addresses as the test input to avoid affecting other systems or users.
