Announcement: "Dear All, I am sharing some sample…"

Dear All,


I am sharing some sample questions for your reference. Please treat them as examples only:
These are for your reference:

1. Do you know anything about Khagam? Khagam? ” .
Who is the speaker of this sentence? Why is the reference to ‘khagam’ given here?

2. So the traveller, borne on the breast of the swift-flowing river, consoled himself with
philosophical reflections on the numberless meetings and partings going on in the
world—on death, the great parting, from which none returns.

Please comment on these lines from Rabindranath Tagore’s “The Postmaster” indicating
their context and the relevance towards the end of the short story. 

Please note the following:

a. Read the questions carefully and answer.

b. Please do not ask "how long" should be the answer. Just decide on the appropriateness of the length yourself. The break-up marks for each question is provided in the question paper. 

c. When asked to 'comment on the context', it means elaborate on the situation referred.

d. When asked to 'comment on the association', it means to explain what you think of the nature of association.

e. You have to answer all the questions. You can choose to answer any question you wish first, just be very careful with mentioning the correct question number.

f. The written exam begins sharp at 3 p.m and ends at 4 p.m. There would not be any extra time (unless its for a serious medical reason). Please be on time and arrive at the venue by 2:45 p.m. 

g. We shall be very strict against any academic misconduct. No one should have any bags, gadgets like smart phones, watches, headphones etc with you near your seats. Only a bottle of water, pen, and institute identity card should be fine.
 
All the best !
