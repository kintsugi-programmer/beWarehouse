**Summary:**

"Squatter" is a short story by Rohinton Mistry, which tells the tale of a man named Sarosh, who lives in Mumbai, India. Here's a simplified explanation:

The story begins with Sarosh, who is homeless, trying to find a place to sleep for the night. He used to have a home, but he lost it due to circumstances beyond his control. Now, he survives by squatting in an empty, dilapidated building.

Sarosh is a resilient character who faces many challenges. He has to deal with the constant fear of being evicted from the building by the authorities or attacked by other homeless people who might want to take his spot. Despite these difficulties, he tries to make the best of his situation.

Sarosh's life is filled with uncertainty and hardship, but he finds moments of solace in small pleasures, like listening to the radio or reminiscing about his past. He longs for a sense of stability and belonging, but it seems elusive to him.

Throughout the story, Sarosh's humanity shines through. Despite his circumstances, he remains compassionate and kind, helping others when he can and forming connections with fellow squatters. He shows that even in the face of adversity, there is still room for kindness and empathy.

In the end, Sarosh's fate remains uncertain. The story leaves us with a sense of the struggles faced by the homeless and the importance of empathy and understanding in a world where many people are marginalized and forgotten.
