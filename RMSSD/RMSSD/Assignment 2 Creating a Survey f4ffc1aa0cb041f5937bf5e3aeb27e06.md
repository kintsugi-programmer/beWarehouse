    **0. This assignment needs to be submitted in groups of 2 (no more than 2 people per group). Please choose your own groups and enter it on the sheet provided on Google Classroom by the 19th October eod.**
    
    **1. Please do not use google forms for this assignment. We will not grade it. It is to be submitted on TurnitIn.**
    
    2. Don’t replace “smoking” with “drinking” or “drunk driving“ with something and blindly  copy the items.
    
    3. You need to develop your questionnaire, complete with your scales and items to test  the entire model.
    
    4. Your assignment will include creation of at least 40 items minimum. Of these there  must at least be 6 demographic items, and at least 1 relevant behavioural aspect. In  addition, the survey must also include approximately 4-items for each of the core  constructs outlined in the model as per your discretion.
    
    5. Your demographic variables and behavioural variable must be relevant to the topic you  are dealing with in your assignment, and should help you to measure how factors listed  above vary, based on demographic characteristics.
    
    6. Across the survey, at least 4 of the items should be reverse coded. These must be  specifically in the following 4 variables: i) Vulnerability, ii) Extrinsic Rewards, (iii)  Response Efficacy, (iv) Response Cost.
    
    7. There should also be an attention testing question as discussed in the class.
    
    8. The survey should look professional, exactly like a survey you would give to your  participants if we were to collect data for a real project. It should be a good to go  one, complete with title, some sort of identifier to ensure anonymity like a  (participant code) scale for each item etc.
    
    6. Please label each variable for which you are developing items. See the example below (1) Perceived Vulnerability
    
    I would become addict if I smoke:

“Smokers die earlier than
nonsmokers.”

Certainly, I can explain these concepts to you:

1. **Relevant Behavior Aspect/Topic Related Introductory Questions:**
    - These are questions designed to introduce a specific topic or behavior that you want to discuss or study. They serve as a way to frame and focus a conversation or research on a particular subject. For example, if you want to discuss exercise habits, you might ask introductory questions like, "How often do you exercise?" or "What motivates you to stay active?"
2. **Perceived Severity:**
    - Perceived severity refers to an individual's subjective assessment of how serious a particular problem or issue is. It is a component of the Health Belief Model, which suggests that people are more likely to take action to prevent or address a health-related issue if they perceive it as a serious threat to their well-being.
3. **Perceived Vulnerability:**
    - Perceived vulnerability is an individual's belief in their susceptibility to a specific risk or threat. In the context of health or risk perception, it relates to how likely someone thinks they are to experience a negative outcome. A high perceived vulnerability can motivate people to take preventive actions.
4. **Intrinsic Rewards:**
    - Intrinsic rewards are personal, internal motivations and satisfactions that come from engaging in a particular behavior or activity. These rewards come from within and include factors like personal enjoyment, a sense of accomplishment, or a feeling of mastery. Intrinsic rewards can be a strong motivator for certain behaviors.
5. **Extrinsic Rewards:**
    - Extrinsic rewards, in contrast to intrinsic rewards, are external incentives or motivators for a behavior. These can include things like money, prizes, recognition, or other tangible rewards that come from outside sources. Extrinsic rewards are used to encourage or reinforce specific behaviors.
6. **Self-Efficacy:**
    - Self-efficacy is a person's belief in their own ability to accomplish a specific task or behavior. It is a crucial concept in social psychology and plays a significant role in motivation and behavior change. High self-efficacy is often associated with increased effort and persistence in achieving goals.
7. **Response Efficacy:**
    - Response efficacy is the belief that a particular action or behavior will effectively lead to the desired outcome. It's related to the perception that if you take a specific action, it will be successful in preventing or addressing a problem or threat.
8. **Attention Testing:**
    - Attention testing refers to assessing or measuring an individual's level of focus, concentration, or attention to specific stimuli, tasks, or information. It is often used in psychology and cognitive science to understand how individuals allocate their attention to various stimuli.
9. **Response Cost:**
    - Response cost refers to the negative consequences or sacrifices associated with a particular behavior or action. It's the "cost" in terms of effort, time, or resources that an individual has to invest in a behavior. High response costs can be a deterrent to engaging in a specific behavior.

These concepts are often used in various fields, including psychology, health promotion, and marketing, to understand and influence human behavior and decision-making.

Here are all the examples (e.g.) extracted from the text you provided:

1. "The three items comprising Severity assess the perceived negative health consequences from smoking, e.g., 'Smokers die earlier than nonsmokers.'"
2. "The three items of the Vulnerability construct measure the perceived likelihood of being affected by tobacco-related negative health consequences, for example 'I would get sick if I smoke.'"
3. "The Intrinsic Rewards items focus on the perceived positive biological and psychological effects from smoking, for example 'Smoking makes people feel comfortable.'"
4. "Next, the tree items compromising Extrinsic Rewards evaluate the perceived psycho-social benefits from smoking, including 'Smoking is good for social networking.'"
5. "The Self-Efficacy items assess an individual’s belief of his or her ability to refuse to smoke tobacco, for example 'No one could persuade me if I do not want to smoke.'"
6. "The Response Efficacy items are focused on an individual’s belief that nonsmoking is an effective approach for good health. A typical item for this construct is 'People will feel good by not smoking.'"
7. "Finally, the three items compromising Response Costs evaluate the perceived psycho-social costs incurred from not smoking, for example 'Refusing a cigarette offer is very impolite.'"
