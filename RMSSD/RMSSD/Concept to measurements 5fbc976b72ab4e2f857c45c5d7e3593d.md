### **How does a researcher think?**

Researchers are curious and inquisitive individuals who are driven to understand the world around them. They are systematic and logical in their approach, and they use evidence to support their conclusions. Researchers are also open-minded and willing to consider new ideas.

### **Concepts**

Concepts are the basic building blocks of research. They are abstract ideas that represent objects, events, or phenomena. For example, "intelligence," "motivation," and "gender" are all concepts.

### **Operational Definitions**

Operational definitions are specific and measurable definitions of concepts. They are necessary for research because they allow us to quantify and compare concepts. For example, an operational definition of "intelligence" might be "IQ score."

### **Units of Analysis**

The unit of analysis is the entity that is being studied in a research project. It can be an individual, a group, an organization, or even a country. For example, if you are studying the effects of a new teaching method, the unit of analysis might be individual students.

### **Variables**

Variables are characteristics of the unit of analysis that can vary. They can be quantitative (e.g., age, income) or qualitative (e.g., gender, race).

### **Types of Variables**

There are four main types of variables:

- Nominal: Variables that have categories but no order. For example, gender (male, female, non-binary)
- Ordinal: Variables that have categories with an order. For example, class rank (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- Interval: Variables that have categories with an order and equal intervals between categories. For example, temperature (Celsius, Fahrenheit)
- Ratio: Variables that have categories with an order, equal intervals between categories, and an absolute zero. For example, age (years)

### **Propositions, Hypothesis, Theories & Model**

- **Propositions:** Tentative and conjectural relationships between concepts that are stated in a declarative form.
- **Hypotheses:** The empirical formulation of propositions, stated as relationships between variables.
- **Theories:** A set of assumptions, propositions, or accepted facts that attempt to provide a plausible or rational explanation of cause-and-effect (causal) relationships among a group of observed phenomenon.
- **Models:** A representation of all or parts of a system that is constructed to study that system.

### **Modes of Reasoning**

There are two main modes of reasoning:

- **Deductive reasoning:** Reasoning from a general principle to a specific case.
- **Inductive reasoning:** Reasoning from a specific case to a general principle.

### **Research Questions and Hypotheses**

A research question is a question that the researcher is hoping to answer through their study. A hypothesis is a statement about the relationship between two or more variables.

### **What is a good research question?**

A good research question is:

- Feasible: It can be answered with the available resources.
- Interesting: It is a topic that the researcher is passionate about.
- Novel: It has not been answered before.
- Ethical: It does not harm or exploit the participants.
- Relevant: It is important to the field of study.

### **How to develop a good research question**

1. Start with a broad topic.
2. Do some preliminary research to learn about topical issues.
3. Narrow down your topic and determine potential research questions.
4. Evaluate the soundness of your research question (Feasible, Interesting, Novel, Ethical, Relevant).
5. Construct your question well using the PICO framework (Richardson, Wilson, Nishikawa and Hayward, 1995).

### **Types of research questions**

- Descriptive: These questions ask about the characteristics of a population or phenomenon.
- Correlational: These questions ask about the relationship between two or more variables.
- Explanatory: These questions ask about the causes of a phenomenon.

### **What is a hypothesis?**

A hypothesis is a statement about the relationship between two or more variables. It is an educated guess about what the researcher expects to find.

### **Types of hypotheses**

- Null hypothesis: The hypothesis that there is no relationship between the two variables.
- Alternative hypothesis: The hypothesis that there is a relationship between the two variables.

### **What is a good hypothesis?**

A good hypothesis is:

- Stated in a declarative form
- Posits a relationship between variables
- Reflects the theory or literature on which they are based

Random

Based on the information provided, here are possible null hypotheses, directional research hypotheses, and non-directional research hypotheses for the given research questions:

**H1: What are the effects of attention span on out-of-seat classroom behavior?**

- **Null hypothesis:** There is no relationship between attention span and out-of-seat classroom behavior.
- **Directional research hypothesis:** Students with shorter attention spans will exhibit more out-of-seat classroom behavior than students with longer attention spans.
- **Non-directional research hypothesis:** There will be a significant difference in out-of-seat classroom behavior between students with shorter and longer attention spans.

**H2: What is the relationship between the quality of marriage and the quality of the spouses' relationships with their siblings?**

- **Null hypothesis:** There is no correlation between the quality of marriage and the quality of the spouses' relationships with their siblings.
- **Directional research hypothesis:** There is a positive correlation between the quality of marriage and the quality of the spouses' relationships with their siblings. This means that couples with happier marriages will also have stronger relationships with their siblings.
- **Non-directional research hypothesis:** There is a significant correlation between the quality of marriage and the quality of the spouses' relationships with their siblings. This means that the two variables are related, but the direction of the relationship (positive or negative) is not specified.

**H3: How does dating anxiety vary as a function of personality traits of an individual?**

- **Null hypothesis:** There is no relationship between personality traits and dating anxiety.
- **Directional research hypothesis:** Individuals with higher levels of neuroticism and introversion will experience more dating anxiety than individuals with lower levels of these traits.
- **Non-directional research hypothesis:** There is a significant correlation between personality traits and dating anxiety. This means that the two variables are related, but the direction of the relationship (positive or negative) is not specified.

**H4: What is the relationship between individual differences in violent video game playing and aggressive behavior in adolescents?**

- **Null hypothesis:** There is no relationship between individual differences in violent video game playing and aggressive behavior in adolescents.
- **Directional research hypothesis:** Adolescents who play more violent video games will exhibit more aggressive behavior than adolescents who play less or no violent video games.
- **Non-directional research hypothesis:** There is a significant correlation between individual differences in violent video game playing and aggressive behavior in adolescents. This means that the two variables are related, but the direction of the relationship (positive or negative) is not specified.
