1. *Semi-Structured Interviews:*
    - Semi-structured interviews offer flexibility in qualitative research.
    - They provide a balance between structure and open-ended exploration.
2. *Axial Coding:*
    - Axial coding involves making connections between categories in qualitative data analysis.
    - It helps in organizing data and uncovering relationships within the information.
3. *Open Codes and Axial Codes:*
    - Open codes represent initial concepts derived directly from data.
    - Axial codes are more focused and connect open codes, forming a more structured analysis.
4. *Data Structure and Categories:*
    - Data structure evolves through the coding process, leading to the formation of categories.
    - Axial coding plays a crucial role in shaping the structure of qualitative data.
5. *Inter-coder Reliability:*
    - Inter-coder reliability is essential for ensuring consistency in coding among different researchers.
    - It involves assessing the degree of agreement between researchers in the coding process.
6. *Negative Case Analysis:*
    - Negative cases are instances that contradict dominant themes in qualitative data.
    - They contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the studied phenomenon.
7. *Psychological Makeup in Qualitative Data:*
    - Individual psychological makeup, including emotional responses, influences qualitative data.
    - Understanding diverse psychological perspectives enhances the richness of data analysis.
8. *Theory Expansion through Negative Cases:*
    - Negative cases contribute to theory expansion by providing alternative perspectives.
    - They help researchers consider nuances and variations in their interpretations.
9. *Cognitive Process in Data Analysis:*
    - The cognitive process in data analysis involves interpreting and categorizing information.
    - Researchers need to be mindful of their assumptions and expectations during analysis.
10. *Reporting Disagreements in Research:*
- Transparency in reporting disagreements among researchers is crucial in published papers.
- It enhances the credibility of research findings and methodologies.
1. *Use of Trigger Source in Data Analysis:*
    - The trigger source concept identifies the source of certain behaviors that trigger emotional responses.
    - It contributes to the formation of categories based on the source of emotions.
2. *Analyzing Emotional Responses:*
    - Emotional responses, such as anger, anxiety, and jealousy, can be categorized based on triggers and psychological attributes.
    - Analyzing emotions adds depth to the understanding of social phenomena in qualitative research.
