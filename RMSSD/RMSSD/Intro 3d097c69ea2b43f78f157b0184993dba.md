# Intro

**Why Social Science Research Methods are Useful for Students of Design and Computer Science**

- **Technologies and social systems are inseparable and interdependent.** To design effective technologies, understanding social systems and human behavior is critical.
- **Social science research methods provide a set of tools to probe social systems.** These tools can help designers to:
    - Understand the needs, emotions, aspirations, and values of users.
    - Challenge existing assumptions about users and products.
    - Redefine problems in order to identify alternative solutions.

**Foundations of Social Science Research**

- **Social science is the study of people or aggregates of people, such as groups, firms, societies, or economies, and their individual or collective behaviors.**
- **Social science includes several disciplines:**
    - Psychology: The science of human behavior.
    - Sociology/Anthropology: The science of social groups and their dynamics.
    - Economics: The science of firms, markets, and economies.

**Design Thinking and Design Research**

- **Design thinking is an iterative process that involves:**
    - Understanding the user.
    - Challenging existing assumptions.
    - Redefining problems.
- **Design research methods are a set of tools and frameworks to:**
    - Understand users.
    - Design products and services in concert with user requirements, user behaviors, and user aspirations.

**Thinking Like a Researcher**

- **Well-designed social scientific methods must satisfy five key characteristics:**
    - Logical
    - Confirmable
    - Repeatable
    - Scrutinizable
    - Empirical

**Classifying Research**

- **There are many different ways to classify research. Some common classifications are:**
    - Purpose: Fundamental research vs. applied research.
    - Depth of scope: Exploratory research vs. descriptive research vs. correlational research.
    - Timeline of data collection: Cross-sectional research vs. longitudinal research.
    - Type of data: Qualitative research vs. quantitative research.
    - Manipulation of variables: Experiments vs. non-experiments.

**Paradigms**

- **A paradigm is a set of beliefs or assumptions about the world that guide scientific research.**
- **Paradigms can shift over time as new evidence emerges.**
- **A paradigm shift is a major change in the way that scientists understand a particular phenomenon.**

**Theories**

- **A theory is a general explanation of a phenomenon.**
- **Theories are based on evidence and are constantly being tested and refined.**
- **Theories can be falsified, but they can never be proven.**

**Conclusion**

Social science research methods are essential for students of design and computer science. These methods provide a set of tools to understand users, challenge assumptions, and design effective technologies.
