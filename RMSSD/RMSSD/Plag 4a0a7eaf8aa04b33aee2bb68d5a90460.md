    **Types of Plagiarism**
    
    Plagiarism can take various forms, including:
    
    1. **Complete Plagiarism:** This involves copying an entire piece of work from one or more sources without any acknowledgment or alteration and submitting it as one's own creation.
    2. **Verbatim Plagiarism:** This involves copying the exact words or phrases from a source without proper citation or quotation marks. This is considered the most blatant form of plagiarism.
    3. **Mosaic Plagiarism:** This involves combining elements from different sources without proper citation, creating a patchwork of borrowed material that appears original.
    4. **Paraphrasing Plagiarism:** This involves paraphrasing the words or ideas of a source without proper citation or failing to adequately change the structure or meaning of the original material.
    5. **Self-Plagiarism or Auto Plagiarism:** This involves reusing one's own previous work without proper citation or acknowledging that the material has been previously published.
    6. **Source-based Plagiarism:** This involves misrepresenting sources, such as referencing a secondary source in one's work but only crediting the primary source. It also includes citing incorrect sources or even making up sources.
    7. **Accidental Plagiarism:** This involves unintentional plagiarism due to carelessness, poor documentation, or a lack of understanding of plagiarism guidelines.

Sure, here are all types of plagiarism with simple and suitable examples:

**Complete Plagiarism:** This is the most serious type of plagiarism, and it occurs when you submit someone else's work as your own without any acknowledgment of the original source. This could include copying and pasting someone else's essay, article, or other work directly into your own work, or it could involve paraphrasing someone else's work without giving them credit.

**Example:** You copy and paste an entire article from a website into your own essay without any citation.

**Verbatim Plagiarism:** This type of plagiarism occurs when you copy someone else's words directly into your own work without using quotation marks or giving credit to the original source.

**Example:** You write in your essay, "Shakespeare said, 'To be or not to be, that is the question.'" However, you do not cite the source of this quote.

**Mosaic Plagiarism:** This type of plagiarism occurs when you copy elements from different sources and combine them to create a new text. While this may seem like a more original way to plagiarize, it is still plagiarism because you are not giving credit to the original sources.

**Example:** You write in your essay, "The use of social media has been linked to an increase in depression and anxiety." You cite two different sources for this information, but you do not mention that you paraphrased one of the sources.

**Paraphrasing Plagiarism:** This type of plagiarism occurs when you paraphrase someone else's work without giving them credit. While paraphrasing can be a legitimate way to use other people's ideas, it becomes plagiarism if you do not give credit to the original source.

**Example:** You write in your essay, "The author argues that social media is addictive." You cite the source of this information, but you do not mention that you paraphrased the author's words.

**Self-Plagiarism:** This type of plagiarism occurs when you reuse your own previous work without giving it proper credit. While it is not as serious as other types of plagiarism, it is still important to cite your own work if you are using it in a new context.

**Example:** You submit an essay that you wrote for a previous class without any changes.

**Source-based Plagiarism:** This type of plagiarism occurs when you cite sources but misrepresent them. For example, you could cite a secondary source in your work but only credit the primary source. It also includes citing incorrect sources or even making up sources.

**Example:** You cite a source in your essay, but you do not actually mention the source in your text.

**Accidental Plagiarism:** This type of plagiarism occurs when you unintentionally plagiarize someone else's work. This could include forgetting to cite sources, not citing correctly, failing to put quotes around cited material, etc.

**Example:** You forget to cite a source that you used in your essay.

These are just a few examples of the different types of plagiarism. It is important to be aware of all of these types of plagiarism so that you can avoid them. If you are ever unsure about whether or not something is plagiarism, it is always best to err on the side of caution and cite your sources.
