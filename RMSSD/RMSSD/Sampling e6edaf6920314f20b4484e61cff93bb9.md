# Sampling

Sure, here is a summary of the lecture on sampling:

## **Sampling**

Sampling is a technique used to select a subset of individuals from a larger population to study the characteristics of the entire population. This is done because it is often impractical or impossible to study the entire population.

## **Types of Sampling**

There are two main types of sampling: probability sampling and non-probability sampling.

### **Probability Sampling**

In probability sampling, each individual in the population has a known chance of being selected for the sample. This means that the sample is representative of the population, and the results of the study can be generalized to the entire population.

Types of probability sampling include:

- Simple random sampling: Each individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected.
- Stratified sampling: The population is divided into subgroups, or strata, and a random sample is selected from each stratum.
- Cluster sampling: The population is divided into clusters, and all individuals within a selected cluster are included in the sample.

### **Non-Probability Sampling**

In non-probability sampling, the individuals in the sample are not selected randomly. This means that the sample may not be representative of the population, and the results of the study cannot be generalized to the entire population.

Types of non-probability sampling include:

- Convenience sampling: The individuals in the sample are the easiest to reach or study.
- Purposive sampling: The individuals in the sample are selected because they have the characteristics that the researcher is interested in.
- Snowball sampling: The individuals in the sample are identified by asking other individuals in the population who they know who fit the criteria for the study.

## **When to Use Sampling**

Sampling is useful when:

- It is impractical or impossible to study the entire population.
- The population is large and diverse.
- The researcher wants to study a specific subgroup of the population.

## **Sampling Frame**

A sampling frame is a list of all the individuals in the population from which the sample is drawn.

## **Sample Size**

The sample size is the number of individuals in the sample. The sample size should be large enough to be representative of the population, but not so large that it is impractical to collect data.

## **Statistical Techniques**

There are a number of statistical techniques that can be used to analyze data collected from a sample. These techniques can be used to estimate the characteristics of the population, to test hypotheses, and to make predictions.

## **Conclusion**

Sampling is a powerful tool that can be used to study populations. When used correctly, sampling can provide accurate and reliable information about the characteristics of a population.
