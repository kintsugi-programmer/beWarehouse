# Survey

Sure, here is a more structured explanation of the slides on the Fundamentals of Survey Research:

**Introduction**

Surveys are a standardized method of collecting data from individuals. They are an excellent tool for gathering information about attitudes, behaviors, thoughts, opinions, interests, intentions, or values. The purpose of a survey research is to generalize from a sample to a population so that inferences can be made about some characteristic, attitude, or behavior of this population.

There are two main types of survey research: cross-sectional and longitudinal. Cross-sectional studies involve collecting data from a sample of individuals at one point in time. Longitudinal studies involve collecting data from the same sample of individuals over a period of time.

**Survey Design: The Time Dimension**

**Cross-Sectional Studies**

Cross-sectional studies are used to make observations of a sample, population, or phenomenon at a single point in time. They are useful for identifying links and associations between variables.

**Longitudinal Studies**

Longitudinal studies are designed to permit observations of the same phenomenon over an extended period of time. They are useful for studying cause-and-effect relationships.

**Self-Administered or Verbally Administered Surveys?**

**Self-Administered Surveys**

Self-administered surveys are surveys that are completed by the respondents themselves. They can be conducted online, by mail, or in person.

**Advantages:**

- Can be conducted with a large number of respondents
- Can be completed at the respondent's convenience
- Can be more anonymous than verbally administered surveys

**Disadvantages:**

- May not be as reliable as verbally administered surveys
- May be more difficult to collect data from certain populations

**Verbally Administered Surveys**

Verbally administered surveys are surveys that are conducted by an interviewer. They can be conducted face-to-face or by telephone.

**Advantages:**

- Can be more reliable than self-administered surveys
- Can be used to collect data from populations that are difficult to reach
- Can be used to clarify questions for respondents

**Disadvantages:**

- Can be more expensive than self-administered surveys
- Can be more time-consuming than self-administered surveys

**Question Types**

There are many different types of survey questions, but some of the most common include:

- **Open-ended questions:** These questions allow respondents to answer in their own words.
- **Closed-ended questions:** These questions have a limited set of possible answers.
- **Likert scale questions:** These questions ask respondents to rate their agreement with a statement on a scale.
- **Demographic questions:** These questions gather information about the respondent's background, such as their age, gender, and education level.

**Reliability and Validity**

Reliability is the extent to which a survey consistently measures the same thing over time. Validity is the extent to which a survey measures what it is intended to measure.

**Reliability**

Reliability is a prerequisite for validity. There are several ways to assess the reliability of a survey, including:

- **Test-retest reliability:** This involves administering the survey to a group of respondents and then repeating the survey with the same group at a later point in time.
- **Internal consistency reliability:** This involves assessing the extent to which the items on a survey measure the same thing.

**Validity**

There are several types of validity, including:

- **Construct validity:** This is the extent to which a survey measures what it is intended to measure.
- **Content validity:** This is the extent to which the items on a survey represent the domain of interest.
- **Criterion validity:** This is the extent to which a survey correlates with other measures of the same construct.

**When to Use a Survey**

Surveys are a useful tool for research, but they are not always the best method. Some of the situations in which surveys are most appropriate include:

- When you want to describe a population
- When you want to make comparisons between different groups of people
- When you want to assess attitudes or opinions
- When you want to understand behaviors

**When Not to Use a Survey**

Surveys are not appropriate for all research situations. Some of the situations in which surveys are not appropriate include:

- When you want to study causal relationships
- When you want to collect data from a very small population
- When you need to collect very detailed data

**Conclusion**

Surveys are a powerful tool for research, but it is important to use them wisely. When used correctly, surveys can provide valuable insights into human behavior.

Sure, here is a more structured explanation of the slides on Designing a Survey:

**Survey Design Outline**

**Preliminary**

1. Define your research objectives: What do you want to learn from your survey?
2. Is a Survey an appropriate method for your study? Consider the research question and the type of data you need to collect.
3. Define your target population: Who are you trying to reach with your survey?
4. How can you make your sample ‘representative’? Ensure that your sample reflects the diversity of your target population.
5. Which Sampling method will you utilize? Random sampling, stratified sampling, purposive sampling, etc.

**Design**

1. Define your research questions: What specific questions do you want to answer with your survey?
2. Select appropriate question types: Consider closed-ended, open-ended, Likert scale, and multiple-choice questions.
3. Develop the survey structure: Create an outline of your survey, organizing questions logically and coherently. Use an introduction to provide context and inform participants about the purpose of the survey.
4. Pilot testing: Test with a small group of participants who resemble the target population. Identify issues with question wording, response options, or survey flow.

**Mistakes in the survey**

- **Question 18:** This question does not provide enough answer choices. The respondent should be able to select from all of the schools or colleges of the University.
- **Question 20:** This question is only relevant to respondents who answered "YES" to question 19. It should be indented and have a note that says "IF YES:" at the beginning.
- **Question 21:** This question is also only relevant to respondents who answered "YES" to question 19. It should be indented and have a note that says "IF YES:" at the beginning.
- **Question 22:** This question is also only relevant to respondents who answered "YES" to question 19. It should be indented and have a note that says "IF YES:" at the beginning.
- **Question 23:** This question is poorly worded. It is not clear what is meant by "math anxiety." The question should be rephrased to be more clear and concise.
- **Question 24:** This question is a double-barreled question. It asks two questions in one: (1) Have you ever had a course in sociological theory or other social theory? and (2) where Marx, Weber, Durkheim, Parsons, Compte and similar theorists were discussed for at least two weeks? The question should be split into two separate questions.
- **Question 25:** This question is leading. It suggests that the respondent should know about the Sociological Department's program "Concentration in Analysis and Research." The question should be rephrased to be more neutral.
- **Question 26:** This question is subjective. There is no way to measure "happiness" objectively. The question should be rephrased to be more objective, or it should be removed from the survey.
- **Question 27:** This question is a Likert scale question, but it does not use a standard Likert scale. The question should be rephrased to use a standard Likert scale, such as the following:
- Very Pro-Choice
- Somewhat Pro-Choice

- Somewhat Pro-Life
- Very Pro-Life
- **Question 28:** This question is subjective and does not provide enough answer choices. The respondent should be able to select from a wider range of political beliefs.
