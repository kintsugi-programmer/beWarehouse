# **Lecture 1 on Ubiquitous Computing (UC) 🌍**  

---

## **📌 Introduction to Ubiquity**
The concept of **ubiquity** refers to the state of being **present everywhere** or being **very common**. In computing, it means integrating technology so seamlessly into daily life that users hardly notice it.  

👀 **Think about it:**  
- Do you ever consciously think about **streetlights**, **Wi-Fi networks**, or **voice assistants** like Alexa? 🤖  
- These technologies blend into our routines and function without demanding active attention.

📖 **Definition of Ubiquity:**  
*"The fact of appearing everywhere or of being very common."*

---

## **💡 What is Ubiquitous Computing (UC)?**
**Mark Weiser**, the father of UC, stated:  

🗨️ *“The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it.”*  

This means that computing should **blend naturally** into the environment, operating in the background while enhancing user experience. 🎭

### **Key Features of UC 🔍**
✅ **Always Present but Unnoticed** – Devices work in the background.  
✅ **Minimal Cognitive Load 🧠** – The user doesn’t need to think about technology to use it.  
✅ **Embedded Everywhere 🌐** – Devices are woven into objects around us.

### **📍 Introduction to mmWave Sensing: FMCW Radars**
🔹 **mmWave radars operate in the 30 GHz - 300 GHz frequency range.**  
🔹 FMCW radars are used for **object detection, velocity measurement, and motion tracking**.  
🔹 Key applications include:  
   - **Self-driving cars 🚗** (collision avoidance & lane detection).  
   - **Industrial automation 🏭** (object positioning & robotics).  
   - **Smart home automation 🏠** (gesture control & security).  

📌 **FMCW radars work by transmitting a "chirp" signal and analyzing its reflection from objects.**  

---

## **🛰️ Fundamentals of FMCW Radar Operation**
#### **📌 What is a Chirp?**
A **chirp** is a sinusoidal signal whose **frequency increases linearly over time**.  

📊 **Key Chirp Parameters:**  
- **Start Frequency (fc):** Initial frequency of the chirp.  
- **Bandwidth (B):** The frequency range swept by the chirp.  
- **Duration (Tc):** The total time for one chirp.  
- **Slope (S):** The rate at which frequency increases (\( S = \frac{B}{Tc} \)).  

💡 **Example Calculation:**  
- If \( B = 4 \) GHz and \( Tc = 40 \) μs, then  
  \( S = \frac{4 GHz}{40 μs} = 100 MHz/μs \).  

---

## **📡 How FMCW Radar Measures Range**  

#### **📌 Step-by-Step Process**
1️⃣ **A synthesizer generates a chirp signal** 📡.  
2️⃣ **The TX antenna transmits the chirp** 📶.  
3️⃣ **The chirp reflects off objects and returns to the RX antenna** 🔄.  
4️⃣ **The received signal is mixed with the transmitted chirp** 🔊.  
5️⃣ **A low-frequency Intermediate Frequency (IF) signal is generated** 🔍.  

💡 **Key Concept:**  
The **IF signal frequency is proportional to object distance**.  

---

## **📏 Calculating Object Distance**
The distance **d** to an object is determined using the **round-trip time delay (τ)** of the reflected chirp.  

📌 **Formula:**  
\[
\tau = \frac{2d}{c}
\]
\[
f_{IF} = S \tau = \frac{S \cdot 2d}{c}
\]

📊 **Example Calculation:**  
- If \( S = 100 MHz/μs \) and an object is **5m away**, then  
  \( \tau = \frac{2(5m)}{3 \times 10^8 m/s} = 33.3 ns \).  
- The IF frequency is  
  \( f_{IF} = (100 MHz/μs) \times (33.3 ns) = 3.33 MHz \).  

🚀 **Takeaway:** **Higher IF frequency means a farther object.**  

---

## **📊 Range Resolution in FMCW Radar**  
📌 **Definition:** **The minimum distance between two objects that allows them to be resolved separately.**  

📌 **Formula:**  
\[
d_{res} = \frac{c}{2B}
\]
where **B** is the chirp bandwidth and **c** is the speed of light.  

📊 **Example:**  
| Bandwidth (B) | Range Resolution (\(d_{res}\)) |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **4 GHz** | **3.75 cm** |
| **2 GHz** | **7.5 cm** |
| **1 GHz** | **15 cm** |
| **600 MHz** | **25 cm** |

🚀 **Takeaway:**  
🔹 **Larger bandwidth → Better resolution**.  
🔹 A **higher chirp bandwidth improves the ability to distinguish close objects**.  

---

## **📡 Measuring Multiple Objects Using Fourier Transforms**
📌 **Key Idea:** If multiple objects exist in front of the radar, each one produces a **distinct IF signal**.  

📊 **Processing Steps:**  
1️⃣ **Convert the time-domain IF signal into the frequency domain using Fourier Transform.**  
2️⃣ **Identify peaks in the frequency spectrum**, where each peak corresponds to an object.  
3️⃣ **The frequency of each peak determines object distance.**  

🔬 **Example:**  
- If **two objects are at 5m and 7m**, their IF signals might be **3.33 MHz & 4.67 MHz**.  
- The **Fourier Transform separates these signals into distinct peaks**.  

🚀 **Takeaway:**  
🔹 **A high-resolution Fourier Transform improves object detection accuracy.**  

---

## **🚗 Velocity Measurement in FMCW Radar**
📌 **Problem:** How do we detect object **motion & speed**?  

📌 **Solution:** **Doppler Effect in FMCW radar.**  

#### **1️⃣ Doppler Shift in Radar**
- If an object moves **toward** the radar, the received chirp is **compressed** (higher frequency).  
- If an object moves **away**, the received chirp is **stretched** (lower frequency).  
- The **Doppler shift** (\( f_D \)) is proportional to object velocity \( v \).  

📌 **Formula for Velocity Estimation:**
\[
v = \frac{\lambda f_D}{2}
\]
where **λ is the radar wavelength**.  

📊 **Example:**  
- If **f_D = 300 Hz** and \( \lambda = 3.9 mm \),  
  \[
  v = \frac{3.9 mm \times 300 Hz}{2} = 0.585 m/s.
  \]  

🚀 **Takeaway:**  
🔹 Faster objects create **larger Doppler shifts**.  

---

## **🛰️ Measuring Velocity Using Multiple Chirps**
📌 **Key Concept:** By transmitting multiple chirps at different times, we can estimate velocity more accurately.  

📊 **Steps:**  
1️⃣ **Transmit two chirps separated by \(T_c\)**.  
2️⃣ **Compare the phase difference (\( \Delta \phi \)) between them**.  
3️⃣ **Estimate velocity using:**  
\[
v = \frac{\lambda \Delta \phi}{4\pi T_c}
\]

📊 **Example:**  
- If \( \Delta \phi = 90^\circ \) and \( T_c = 40 μs \),  
  \[
  v = \frac{3.9 mm \times 90^\circ}{4\pi \times 40 μs} = 0.78 m/s.
  \]  

🚀 **Takeaway:**  
🔹 **Phase-based velocity estimation is highly accurate for slow-moving objects.**  

---

## **🔭 Angle Estimation (Angle of Arrival - AoA)**
📌 **Problem:** How do we determine the **direction of an object**?  

📌 **Solution:** **Multiple antennas using phase differences.**  

#### **📌 Key Formula:**
\[
\theta = \sin^{-1} \left( \frac{\lambda \Delta \phi}{2\pi d} \right)
\]
where **d** is the antenna spacing.  

📊 **Example:**  
- If \( d = \frac{\lambda}{2} \) and \( \Delta \phi = 45^\circ \),  
  \[
  \theta = \sin^{-1} \left( \frac{\lambda \times 45^\circ}{2\pi \times \lambda/2} \right) = 22.5^\circ.
  \]  

🚀 **Takeaway:**  
🔹 **More antennas → More accurate angle estimation.**
